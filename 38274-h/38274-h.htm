small influence in moulding
the opinions of most
people can scarcely be
denied; and therefore in
our estimate of the architectural
value of a church
the door is an element
of some importance. A
shabby and undignified
entrance raises no expectations
of a lofty and solemn
interior; and that interior
must be emphatically fine, if we are not to read
into it some of the meanness of its portal. On
the other hand, though the church be but plain

 </span></span>and simple&mdash;so that it lack not a measure of the
dignity which may well accompany simplicity&mdash;our
thoughts will be raised and fitted to find in
it something worthy of its high purpose, if we
have been prepared by passing through a noble
porch, and beneath a doorway that speaks itself
the entrance to no ordinary dwelling.</p>

<p>In primitive times the approach to a church
must have been full of dignity, the worshippers
being warned, by successive gates and doors, of
the sacredness of the building which they were
about to enter. Eusebius gives us a full account
of a splendid church built at Tyre by Paulinus,
from which we may gather the plan on which
such buildings were erected in the primitive
ages, when the means were forthcoming, and no
opposition from the heathen world prevented.</p>

<p>The whole church at Tyre and its precincts
were enclosed within a wall, at the front of which
was a stately porch, known as the “great porch,”
or the “first entrance.” Passing through this
the worshipper entered the courtyard, or <i>atrium</i>,
round which ran a covered portico, or cloister,
and in the centre of which was a fountain, or
cistern, of water. Opposite the “great porch”
was the door into the church itself; at Tyre
<a name="p3" id="p3"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>there were (as in many of our cathedrals) three
such doors, a large one in the centre, flanked by
smaller ones at some distance along the wall.
These opened into a vestibule, or ante-temple,
from which admittance was gained into the nave
of the church by yet another door or gate.</p>

<p>Each of the spaces formed by these several
barriers had its special use. Within the <i>atrium</i>
all the worshippers washed their hands as a
preparation, both literal and emblematic, for
assisting in the sacred mysteries; here, too,
penitents under censure for the most flagrant
sins remained during the divine offices, and
besought the prayers of their brethren as they
passed on to those holier courts, from which for
a time they were themselves excluded. Within
this open courtyard, also, as in a modern churchyard,
burials were sometimes permitted. The
portico beyond the second entrance was the
place for the “hearers,” that is for those who
were not yet sufficiently instructed in the faith
to be allowed to be present except at the reading
of the Scriptures and the sermons (these were
catechumens in their noviciate and the heathens
and Jews), and also for those Christians who
were degraded temporarily to the same position
<a name="p4" id="p4"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>as a penance for some sin. Beyond this portico,
the nave was still further divided for the separation
of different orders of penitents; so that the
faithful in possession of all their privileges had
quite a number of doors or gates through which
to pass before reaching that place, immediately
outside the apse, or chancel, which it was their
right to occupy.</p>

<p>In order that the several classes of persons
attending church might be kept strictly within
those portions of the building which were
assigned to them, a special order of door-keepers
existed in the Church. The keys of the church
were solemnly delivered to these <i>ostiarii</i>, and
they were accounted to form the lowest in rank
of the minor orders. The simple words of the
commission, uttered by the bishop to the
<i>ostiarius</i>, were, “Behave thyself as one that
must give an account to God of the things that
are kept under these keys.” Such was the formula
prescribed by the fourth Council of Carthage
(398&nbsp;<span class="postnomial">A.D.</span>), and found in the Roman ritual of the
eighth century. This order of clergy was almost
confined to the west, however; we find traces of
its existence at one time at Constantinople, but
for the most part the deacons guarded the men’s
<a name="p7" id="p7"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>entrance, and sub-deacons or deaconesses the
women’s, in the east.</p>

 /><small>WEST DOOR, HOLY TRINITY, COLCHESTER.</small>
</div>

<p>In the earliest English churches the entrance
was of a very simple nature; for the artistic skill
of the people was small, and their ideals were
unambitious. The buildings consisted of a nave
without clerestory, and a chancel; the door
being placed in the centre of the western wall.
A curious example of such a door meets us at
Holy Trinity, Colchester, although in this case
it gives admittance not into the nave directly,
but through the ancient tower. This tower, the
oldest part of the church, has been constructed
of the fragments of buildings older still; the
Roman bricks of the ruined city of Camulodunum
having been used to form it. In the western side
is a narrow doorway, contained by two square
shafts with very simple capitals, and having a
triangular head with an equally simple moulding
by way of drip-stone. The date is supposed to
be between 800 and 1000&nbsp;<span class="postnomial">A.D.</span> A church perhaps
yet older is that of S.&nbsp;Lawrence at Bradford-on-Avon,
which has a good claim to be the veritable
structure reared by S.&nbsp;Aldhelm in the first years
of the eighth century. Here there is a northern
porch of unusual size in proportion to the rest of
<a name="p8" id="p8"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the building; the entrance to which is by means
of an arched doorway, tall and narrow. The
narrowness of some of these ancient doorways is
remarkable. At Sowerford-Keynes is one, now
built up, which, though nearly nine feet high, is
but 1&nbsp;foot 9&nbsp;inches wide at the springing of the
arch, widening towards the base to 2&nbsp;feet 5½
inches. The jambs are of “short and long”
work, and the abacus has a very simple zig-zag
moulding. The arch itself is not built up, but
carved out of one stone, which is cut square on
the upper side and scooped into a parabolic
curve on the lower. A double row of cable
moulding decorates it. This, which has been
called “one of the most characteristic specimens
of Saxon architecture in England,” was the
northern entrance to the church. Another
instance of a western door of simple design is
supplied by Crowle, or Croule, in north Lincolnshire.
Here we meet with a rectangular doorway,
the top of which is formed of one long stone, on
which is some antique carving and a fragment of
a runic inscription.<sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnm1" id="fnm1"
 title="go to footnote 1">1</a></sup> Above this is a tympanum
filled with diamond-shaped stones of small size.</p>

<p><a name="p9" id="p9"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>9<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>With the rise of the so-called Norman style of
architecture the doors of our churches took a
handsomer form; and as the churches themselves
were now formed on a larger and nobler plan,
more than one entrance was often required. The
usual door for the people was now commonly
placed at the south side, except in churches
connected (as were so many of our cathedrals)
with monastic foundations. In this latter case
the south side was generally occupied by the
cloisters and other conventual buildings, and the
people’s door was therefore placed upon the
north side. At this period, too, the church-porch
begins its development; for, although porches
in a strict sense were at any rate not usual, the
door-way deeply sunk in the massive wall and
protected by three, four, or even more concentric
arches, suggests the more fully developed shelter
of the porch. Of doors of this kind any of our
older abbey-churches will supply adequate, and
often splendid, examples. The great north door
of Durham Cathedral, and the smaller, but not
less beautiful doors into the cloisters there, are
fine instances. The west and north doors of the
little cathedral of Llandaff supply examples in
another class of building; and even small and
<a name="p10" id="p10"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>obscure parish churches are sometimes dignified
with the possession of an entrance full of the
massive solemnity of this Norman work. The
village church of Heysham, on Morecambe Bay,
has a south door well worthy of mention in
this connection; and the Lincolnshire church
already cited, Crowle, has an interesting doorway
of this kind.</p>

<p>As art progressed in Christendom, and exhibited
its growing force especially in the
churches, the entrances thereto shared in the
increasing splendour of the whole. The mouldings
of the arches and the pillars, the elaboration
of capitals and bases, all showed the evidence of
devotion guided by taste and skill. And often
something more than mere decoration was
attempted; the opportunity was seized to add
instruction, and figures of saints and angels, or
complete scenes from scriptural or ecclesiastical
story, filled the expanse of the tympanum or
the niches of the columns. About the twelfth
century, also, it became customary to divide the
main entrance into two by means of a pillar, or
a group of pillars; the two-leaved door being
thus made symbolical of the two natures of
Christ, of Whom, as Durandus tells us, it is itself
<a name="p11" id="p11"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the emblem, “according to that saying in the
Gospel, ‘I am the Door!’”</p>

<p>The Continent presents some splendid examples
of these decorated porticoes. The
cathedral of Strasburg, preserved as by a series
of miracles in spite of every danger that can
assail a building, fire, lightning, earthquake,
and cannonade, has a very grand west entrance;
its tall doors set within a number of receding
arches, and the sharply-pointed gable which
crowns them flanked and crested with tapering
pinnacles. The French artists of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries were unrivalled in the
beauty and wealth of statuary with which they
adorned their churches, and not least their doors.
“The glory and the beauty” of the great porch
at Amiens has been set forth fully by Ruskin,
who has woven into one wonderful whole the
meaning of the statues, which, like “a cloud of
witnesses,” throng the western front. But
Amiens is not alone; S.&nbsp;Denis, Paris, Sens,
Angouléme, Poictiers,<!-- TN: sic --> Autun, Chartres, Laon,
Rheims, Vezelay, Auxerre, and other cathedrals
are all magnificent in this respect. The principal
entrance to Seville cathedral is flanked by
columns upholding niches filled with figures of
<a name="p12" id="p12"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>saints and angels, while the tympanum contains
a carving of the entrance of the Saviour into
Jerusalem on the first Palm Sunday. In the
island of Majorca, the south door-way of the
cathedral of Palma is exceptionally beautiful.
The statue of the Blessed Virgin crowns the
centre column, and above is the Last Supper.
A record of the architect of this splendid piece
of work is preserved in an old account book of
the cathedral: “On January 29th, 1394, Master
Pedro Morey, sculptor, master artificer of the
south door, which was begun by him, passed
from this life. Anima ejus requiescat in pace.
Amen.” The entrance in the west front is also
a fine one, and is inscribed, “Non est factum
tale opus in universis regnis.”</p>

 /><small>WEST DOOR, HIGHAM FERRERS CHURCH.</small>
</div>

<p>Although in England we cannot match the
gorgeousness of detail exhibited by the flamboyant
architecture of some of the examples above
noticed, yet we too have instances of which
we may well be proud. The western front of
Peterborough cathedral, over the partial renovation
of which there has recently been so much
controversy between architects and antiquaries,
has been pronounced to be “the grandest portico
in Europe;” but this has reference to the whole
<a name="p13" id="p13"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>façade rather than to the door-way in itself. If
our subject allowed of our taking so wide a view,
the splendid west fronts of Exeter, York, and
others of our minsters, would demand a place of
honour in the list. Gloucester cathedral has a
dignified porch over the south door, in which are
the figures of a number of saints. The west door
<a name="p14" id="p14"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of Rochester is also interesting; its decorated
Norman arches are richly carved, and enclose a
tympanum covered with characteristic sculpture.
Of a different type is the graceful west door
at Ely, whose pointed arches are upheld by
delicately cut shafts, the tympanum over the
twin doorways being pierced by a double trefoil
within a vesica. The parish church of Higham
Ferrers has double western doors, separated by
a bold shaft, above which is a niche (now unoccupied)
for a statue. The tympanum, anciently
divided by this figure, has five medallions on
each side filled with sculptured scenes from the
New Testament, round which runs a scroll of
conventional foliage. The neighbouring churches
of Rushden and Raunds have also good double-leaved
doors. To take one instance from the
Northern Kingdom, S.&nbsp;Giles’s, Edinburgh, has
a dignified west entrance. Many of the better
examples of our modern churches have admirable
porticoes, of which one example must suffice.
All Saints’ Church, Cheltenham, has double
doors within receding arches; the tympanum
has the figure of Our Lord enthroned in glory
surrounded by the saints, and the central shaft
and the side pillars contain other statues.</p>

<p><a name="p15" id="p15"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>15<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>There is occasionally found in a cathedral, or
other large church, a porch of unusual depth,
known as a Galilee. Here, during Lent, those
assembled who were bidden to do public penance;
the coming of Maundy Thursday being the signal
for their admission once more into the church
itself. Ely has a western Galilee entered by an
arch, divided by a central pillar, and filled in the
upper part with tracery. Lincoln has a Galilee,
deep and dignified in plan, with a vaulted roof.
Another English cathedral so provided is that
of Chichester; and among parish churches the
Galilee is found at Boxley, Llantwit, Chertsey,
and S.&nbsp;Woolos.</p>

<p>Of door-ways which, independently of considerations
of date, size, or form, are noteworthy
for their sculpture, there are many that ought to
be mentioned. At Lincoln, for instance, we
have a south door carved with a Doom, or Last
Judgment, wherein we see the effigy of the
Divine Judge surrounded by the dead rising
from their opening graves. The north door at
Ely, the whole of the surrounding stone-work of
which is elaborately carved, is surmounted by
the figure of the Lord enthroned within a vesica,
while adoring angels kneel before Him. At
<a name="p16" id="p16"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Rougham, in Norfolk, the west door is surmounted
by a crucifix, round which runs the
emblematic vine. Founhope church, Hereford,
has in the tympanum of the arch the Madonna
and the Holy Child, a grotesque with birds and
beasts surrounding the figures. At Elkstone,
Gloucestershire, the south door-way, a specimen
(like the one at Founhope) of Norman work, has
some interesting sculptures. In the centre of
the tympanum is Christ enthroned, with the
apocalyptic symbols of the evangelists around
Him; beyond these on the right hand of Christ
is the Agnus Dei with the flag, an emblem of the
Resurrection, while on the left is a wide open
pair of jaws, known as a Hell-mouth: above all
the Father’s Hand is seen in the attitude of
benediction. Elstow church has sculptured
figures above the north door; not within the
containing arch, but within a separate arched
space divided from the door-way by a string-course.
Haltham church, in Lincolnshire, has
some exceedingly curious designs on the
tympanum of the south door; they are mostly
cruciform figures within circles, and are arranged
with strange irregularity. The north door of
Lutterworth church has over it a fresco painting.</p>

<p><a name="p17" id="p17"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>17<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Several of the churches in Brussels have
door-ways which, though otherwise not remarkable,
are noteworthy from the beauty of the
carving of the central post dividing the two
leaves of the door. The church of Notre Dame
de Bon-Secours has the effigy of its patron saint
crowned and robed,
bearing the Infant
Saviour; below are
the emblems of pilgrimage,
wallets,
gourds, and cockle-shells.
The church
of La Madeleine
has a crucifix with
a weeping Magdalene
at its foot.
The old church of
S.&nbsp;Catharine has
its patroness on the door-post, and the Chapelle
Sainte-Anne similarly has S.&nbsp;Anne holding the
Blessed Virgin by the hand. Foliage or scrolls
in each case fill up the rest of the column,
which is of wood, and in some instances has
been painted.</p>

<p>So far, the doorways have occupied our
<a name="p18" id="p18"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>attention; something must, however, be said of
the doors themselves. The usual form of the old
church door is familiar enough to all of us; the
massive time-stained oak, the heavy iron nails
that stud it, and the long broad hinges that reach
almost across its full breadth. There is dignity
in the very simplicity of all this; but not seldom
far more ornate examples may be found.</p>

<p>The most elementary form of decoration consists
in merely panelling the door, as is the case
in numberless instances; occasionally the panels
themselves are carved, as on the “Thoresby
Door,” at Lynn, or the door of S.&nbsp;Mary’s, Bath;
or tracery, as in a window, is introduced, as at
Alford, Lincolnshire. These are but a few of the
many instances which might be cited. Another
striking form of decoration is produced by
hammering out the long hinges into a design
covering, more or less, the surface of the door.
The west door at Higham Ferrers, already
noticed, has on each of its leaves three hinges,
which are formed into wide spreading scrolls.
Sempringham Abbey has very fine beaten ironwork
spread over almost the entire face of the
door. A more curious example is afforded by
Dartmouth church; where a conventional tree
<a name="p19" id="p19"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>with spreading branches covers the door, and
across this the hinges are laid in the form of two
heraldic lions. The date is added in the middle
of the work, 1631.</p>

<div class="illo">

<p>In the decoration of the church door the
mediæval blacksmith proves himself in a thousand
instances, at home and abroad, to have been an
artist. Free from the hurry of the present age,
he could work according to that canon of
Chaucer’s,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;">

nor even the hand and head; but the soul within
him gave life to both. Of the contrast
between old ways and new, few examples are
more striking than the hinges of the door at
S.&nbsp;Mary Key, Ipswich; where we have a simple
but graceful scroll of ancient date, and a clumsy
iron bar of to-day, lying side by side. For a
beautiful design in beaten iron the doors of
Worksop Priory may claim to have not many rivals.</p>

probably the bronze doors of the Baptistery at
Florence. Other bronze doors there are on the
Continent, and all of them fine; Aix-la-Chapelle,
Mayence, Augsburg, Hildesheim, Novgorod, all
have doors of this kind; at Verona, too, in the
church of San Zeno, are ancient examples,
whereon are set forth in panels a number of
subjects from Holy Scripture and from the life
of the patron saint. All, however, fall into
<a name="p22" id="p22"></a><span class="pageno"><span

</div>

<p>In 1400 the Gild of Cloth Merchants of
Florence decided to make a thank-offering for
the cessation of the plague; and the form which
it took was a pair of bronze doors for the
baptistery of the church of S.&nbsp;Giovanni, to
correspond with some already there. These
earlier ones are the work of Pisana and his son
Nino, from designs by Giotto; the creation of
the new ones was thrown open to competition.
Many competitors appeared, of whom six were
asked to submit specimens of designs for the
panels; and, finally, when the choice lay between
two only, the elder, Brunellesco, himself advised
that the commission should be entrusted to
Ghiberti, a youth then barely twenty years of
age. The doors when completed contained
twenty scenes from the Saviour’s life, together
with figures of the four Latin Doctors and the
four Evangelists, set in a frame of exquisite
foliage. This splendid work was surpassed by a
second pair of doors subsequently made for the
same place. In this there are ten panels setting
forth scenes from the Old Testament history;
and the frame is adorned with niches and
<a name="p23" id="p23"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>medallions in which are placed some fifty
allegorical figures and portrait heads. It was of
these last doors, which were only completed in
Ghiberti’s mature age, that no less a judge than
Michael Angelo said, “They might stand as the
gates of Paradise itself.”</p>

<p>Aix-en-Provence claims that her doors are as
peerless as examples of the wood-carver’s art, as
are the Florentine ones as types of the metal-worker’s.
They have been preserved, it is said,
from the sixth century, and are still wonderfully
fresh and delicate. There are on each door six
upper panels filled with figures of the twelve
Sybils; and below one large panel, occupied, in
one case, by effigies of the prophets Isaiah and
Jeremiah, and in the other by Ezekiel and
Daniel. The carving is only occasionally exhibited,
two masking doors having been cleverly
contrived to protect and cover the real ones.</p>

<p>Many of the doors of our cathedrals and great
abbey churches have knockers, often of very
striking designs. These as a rule indicate that
the places in question claimed the right of
sanctuary; and the knocker was to summon an
attendant, or watcher, to admit the fugitive from
justice at night, or at other times when the
<a name="p24" id="p24"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>entrance was closed. A curious head holding
a ring within its teeth forms the knocker at
Durham cathedral; a lion’s head was not an
uncommon form for this to take, as at Adel,
York (All Saints), and Norwich (S.&nbsp;Gregory’s);
a singularly ferocious lion’s head knocker may
be seen at Mayence.</p>

<p>The deep porch which we so frequently see
over the principal door of the church was formerly
something more than an ornament, or even a
protection; it was a recognized portion of the
sacred building, and had its appointed place in
the services of the Church. Baptism was
frequently administered in the church porch, to
symbolize that by that Sacrament the infant
entered into Holy Church. There are still relics
of the existence of fonts in some of our porches,
as at East Dereham, Norfolk. When baptism
was thus administered in the south porch, it was
also customary, so it is alleged, to throw wide
open the north door; that the devil, formally
renounced in that rite, might by that way flee
“to his own place.” The font now usually
stands just within the door. In the pre-reformation
usage of the Church the thanksgiving of a
woman after child-birth was also made in, or
<a name="p25" id="p25"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>before, the church porch; and concluded with
the priest’s saying, “Enter into the temple of
God, that thou mayest have eternal life, and live
for ever and ever.” The first prayer-book of
Edward&nbsp;VI. ordered the woman to kneel “nigh
unto the quire door:” the next revision altered
the words “to nigh unto the place where the
table standeth;” and from Elizabeth’s days the
rubric has simply said indefinitely “a convenient
place.”</p>

<p>The rubric at the commencement of the Order
of the Solemnization of Holy Matrimony according
to the Sarum use began also in this way:
“Let the man and woman be placed before the
door of the church, or in the face of the church,
before the presence of God, the Priest, and the
People”; at the end of the actual marriage, and
before the benedictory prayers which follow<!-- TN: original reads "foilow" --> it,
the rubric says, “Here let them go into the
church to the step of the altar.” Chaucer
alludes to this usage when in his “Canterbury
Tales” he says of the wife of <span class="nw">Bath&mdash;</span></p>

 </span></span>Canterbury Cathedral on September 9th, 1299,
and other mediæval notices of the custom occur.</p>

<p>The first prayer-book of Edward&nbsp;VI. introduced
an alteration which has been maintained ever
since; the new rubric reading that “The persons
to be married shall come into the body of the
Church,” just as it does in our modern prayer-books.
In France the custom survived as late
as the seventeenth century, at least in some
instances, for the marriage of Charles&nbsp;I., who
was represented by a proxy, and Henrietta Maria
was performed at the door of Notre Dame in
Paris. In Herrick’s “Hesperides” is a little
poem entitled “The Entertainment, or, <em>A Porch-verse</em>
at the marriage of Mr. Henry Northly and
the most witty Mrs. Lettice Yard.” It <span class="nw">commences:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width:24em;">
<div class="stanza">
<div> “Welcome! but yet no entrance till we blesse</div>
<div>  First you, then you, then both for white success.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was published in the midst of the great
Civil War, and seems to show that the custom
of marriage at the church porch was still
sufficiently known, even if only by tradition, to
make allusions to it “understanded of the
people.”</p>

<p>Burials sometimes took place in the church
<a name="p27" id="p27"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>porch, in those days when interment within the
building was much sought after.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical Courts were frequently held
in church porches, as at the south door of
Canterbury Cathedral; schools were occasionally
established in them; and here the dower of the
bride was formally presented to the bridegroom.
This last-named use of the porch is illustrated
by a deed of the time of Edward&nbsp;I., by which
Robert Fitz Roger, a gentleman of Northamptonshire,
bound himself to marry his son within a
given time to Hawisia, daughter of Robert de
Tybetot, and “to endow her at the church door”
with property equal to a hundred pounds per
annum. We still have evidence of the fact that
the church door was of old considered the most
prominent and public place in the parish in the
continued use of it as the official place for posting
legal notices of general interest, such as lists of
voters, summonses for public meetings, and so
forth.</p>

<p>There are often in connection with ancient
ecclesiastical foundations doors and gateways
which are of great interest, though they can
scarcely be called church doors. Of this class
are the entrances to the chapter houses of
<a name="p28" id="p28"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>cathedrals, many of which are very fine. At
York, for example, the chapter-house, which
proudly asserts in an inscription near the entrance
that, “as the rose is among the flowers, so is it
among buildings,” has a doorway not unworthy
of the beautiful interior.</p>

<p>The gateway which gave admittance to the
sacred enclosure of the abbey&mdash;the garth or close
round which were ranged the monastic buildings&mdash;is
in many cases an imposing and elaborate
piece of architecture. Bristol has an interesting
Norman gateway, and that at Durham is massive
and impressive, as are all the conventual remains
there. Norwich is specially rich in this respect.
The Erpingham Gate was the gift of Sir Thomas
Erpingham, who died in 1420, and whom the
King, in Shakespere’s play of “King Henry&nbsp;V.”
(Act&nbsp;iv. sc.&nbsp;I), calls a “good old knight;”
S.&nbsp;Ethelbert’s Gate was built at the cost of Bishop
Alnwick, who ruled the see from 1426 to 1436.</p>

<p>But to speak of these things is to wander from
our present subject, and even that is too wide to
be dealt with fully in a paper such as this. The
legends and traditions of the church porch might
occupy many a page, while we gossiped over the
mystic rites of S.&nbsp;John’s Eve or of All Hallow
<a name="p29" id="p29"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>E’en; or while we told how Ralph, Bishop of
Chichester, barred his cathedral door with thorns
in his anger against the King and his friends; or
how the skins of marauding Danes have in more
than one instance been nailed as leather coverings
to the doors of English churches. Enough,
however, has probably been said to show the
wealth of interest which may often be found to
hang about the old church porch, in which
the village church may often be as rich as the
great cathedral or the stately abbey.</p>

 /></span></span>Sacrificial Foundations.</h2>

<p class="author">By England Howlett.</p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">In</span> early ages a sacrifice of some sort or other
was offered on the foundation of nearly
every building. In heathen times a sacrifice
was offered to the god under whose protection
the building was placed; in Christian times,
while many old pagan customs lingered on, the
sacrifice was continued, but was given another
meaning. The foundation of a castle, a church,
or a house was frequently laid in blood; indeed
it was said, and commonly believed, that no
edifice would stand firmly for long unless the
foundation was laid in blood. It was a practice
frequently to place some animal under the corner
stone&mdash;a dog, a wolf, a goat, sometimes even the
body of a malefactor who had been executed.</p>

<p>Heinrich Heine <span class="nw">says:&mdash;</span>“In the middle ages
the opinion prevailed that when any building was
to be erected something living must be killed,
in the blood of which the foundation had to be
laid, by which process the building would be
<a name="p31" id="p31"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>secured from falling; and in ballads and traditions
the remembrance is still preserved how
children and animals were slaughtered for the
purpose of strengthening large buildings with
their blood.”</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:22em;">
<div class="stanza">
<div>   “ .  .  .  I repent:</div>
<div>    There is no sure foundation set on blood,</div>
<div>    No certain life achiev’d by other’s death.”</div>

<p>To many of our churches tradition associates
some animal and it generally goes by the name
of the Kirk-grim. These Kirk-grims are of
course the ghostly apparitions of the beasts that
were buried under the foundation-stones of the
churches, and they are supposed to haunt the
churchyards and church lanes. A spectre dog
which went by the name of “Bargest” was said
to haunt the churchyard at Northorpe, in
Lincolnshire, up to the first half of the present
century. The black dog that haunts Peel Castle,
and the bloodhound of Launceston Castle, are
the spectres of the animals buried under their
walls. The apparitions of children in certain
old mansions are the faded recollections of the
sacrifices offered when these houses were first
<a name="p32" id="p32"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>erected, not perhaps the present buildings, but
the original halls or castles prior to the conquest,
and into the foundations of which children were
often built. The Cauld Lad of Hilton Castle in
the valley of the Wear is well known. He is
said to wail at night:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:14em;">
<div class="stanza">
<div>   “Wae’s me, wae’s me,</div>
<div>    The acorn’s not yet</div>
<div>    Fallen from the tree</div>
<div>    That’s to grow the wood,</div>
<div>    That’s to make the cradle,</div>
<div>    That’s to rock the bairn,</div>
<div>    That’s to grow to a man,</div>
<div>    That’s to lay me.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Afzelius, in his collection of Swedish folk tales,
says: “Heathen superstition did not fail to
show itself in the construction of Christian
churches. In laying the foundations the people
retained something of their former religion, and
sacrificed to their old deities, whom they could
not forget, some animal, which they buried alive,
either under the foundation, or within the wall.
A tradition has also been preserved that under
the altar of the first Christian churches a lamb
was usually buried, which imparted security
and duration to the edifice. This was an
emblem of the true church lamb&mdash;the Saviour,
<a name="p33" id="p33"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>who is the corner stone of His church. When
anyone enters a church at a time when there is
no service, he may chance to see a little lamb
spring across the choir and vanish. This is the
church-lamb. When it appears to a person in
the churchyard, particularly to the grave-digger,
it is said to forbode the death of a child that
shall be next laid in the earth.”</p>

<p>The traditions of Copenhagen are, that when
the ramparts were being raised the earth always
sank, so that it was impossible to get it to stand
firm. They therefore took a little innocent girl,
placed her on a chair by a table, and gave her
playthings and sweetmeats. While she thus sat
enjoying herself, twelve masons built an arch
over her, which when completed they covered
over with earth, to the sound of music with
drums and trumpets. By this process they are,
it is said, rendered immovable.<sup><a href="#fn2" name="fnm2" id="fnm2"
 title="go to footnote 2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It is an old saying that there is a skeleton in
every house, a saying which at one time was
practically a fact. Every house in deed and in
truth had its skeleton, and moreover every house
was designed not only to have its skeleton, but
its ghost also. The idea of providing every
<a name="p34" id="p34"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>building with its ghost as a spiritual guard was
not of course the primary idea; it developed later
out of the original pagan belief of a sacrifice
associated with the beginning of every work of
importance. Partly with the notion of offering
a propitiatory sacrifice to mother earth, and
partly also with the idea of securing for ever a
portion of soil by some sacrificial act, the old
pagan laid the foundation of his house in blood.</p>

<p>The art of building in early ages was not well
understood, and the true principles of architecture
and construction were but little appreciated.
If the walls of a building showed any signs of
settlement the reason was supposed to be that
the earth had not been sufficiently propitiated,
and that as a consequence she refused to carry
the burden imposed upon her.</p>

<p>It is said that when Romulus was about to
found the city of Rome he dug a deep pit and
cast into it the “first fruits of everything that is
reckoned good by use, or necessary by nature,”
and before the pit was closed up by a great
stone, Faustulus and Quinctilius were killed and
laid under it. The legend of Romulus slaying
his twin brother Remus because he jumped the
walls of the city to show how poor they were,
<a name="p35" id="p35"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>probably arises out of a confusion of the two
legends and has become associated with the
idea of a sacrificial foundation. To the present
day there is a general Italian belief that whenever
any great misfortune is going to overtake
the city of Rome the giant shadow of Remus
may be seen walking over the highest buildings
in the city, even to the dome of St. Peter’s.</p>

<p>Sacrifice was not by any means confined to
the foundations of buildings only. A man
starting on a journey or on any new and
important work would first offer a sacrifice. A
ship was never launched without a sacrifice, and
the christening of a vessel in these days with a
bottle of wine is undoubtedly a relic of the time
when the neck of a human being was broken
and the prow of the vessel suffused with blood
as a sacrificial offering.</p>

<p>In our own time the burial of a bottle with
coins under a foundation stone is the faded
memory of the immuring of a human victim.
So hard does custom and superstition die that
even in the prosaic nineteenth century days we
cannot claim to be altogether free from the
bonds and fetters with which our ancestors were
bound.</p>

<p><a name="p36" id="p36"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>36<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Grimm, in his German Mythology, tells us:
“It was often considered necessary to build
living animals, even human beings, into the
foundations on which any edifice was reared, as
an oblation to the earth to induce her to bear
the superincumbent weight it was proposed to
lay upon her. By this horrible practice it was
supposed that the stability of the structure was
assured as well as other advantages gained.”
Of course the animal is merely the more modern
substitute for the human being, just in the same
manner as at the present day the bottle and
coins are the substitute for the living animal. In
Germany, after the burial of a living being under
a foundation was given up, it became customary
to place an empty coffin under the foundations
of a house, and this custom lingered on in
remote country districts until comparatively
recent times.</p>

<p>With the spread of Christianity the belief in
human sacrifice died out. In 1885, Holsworthy
Parish Church was restored; during the work of
restoration it was necessary to take down the
south-west angle of the wall, and in this wall
was found, embedded in the mortar and stone, a
skeleton. The wall of this part of the church
<a name="p37" id="p37"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>had settled, and from the account given by the
masons it would seem there was no trace of a
tomb, but on the contrary every indication that
the victim had actually been buried alive&mdash;a
mass of mortar covered the mouth, and the
stones around the body seemed to have been
hastily built. Some few years ago the Bridge
Gate of the Bremen city walls was taken down,
and the skeleton of a child was found embedded
in the foundations.<sup><a href="#fn3" name="fnm3" id="fnm3"
 title="go to footnote 3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The practice of our masons of putting the
blood of oxen into mortar was no doubt in the
first instance associated with the idea of a
sacrifice; however this may be, the blood had no
doubt a real effect in hardening the mortar, just
the same as treacle, which has been known to be
used in our days. The use of cement when any
extra strength is needed has put aside the use of
either blood or treacle in the mixing of mortar.</p>

<p>It is a curious instance of the wide spread of
the belief in blood as a cement for ancient
buildings that Alá-ud-din Khilji, the King of
Delhi, <span class="postnomial">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1296&ndash;1315, when enlarging and
strengthening the walls of old Delhi, is reported
to have mingled in the mortar the bones and
<a name="p38" id="p38"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>blood of thousands of goat-bearded Moghuls,
whom he slaughtered for the purpose. A modern
instance is furnished by advices which were
brought from Accra, dated December 8th, 1881,
that the King of Ashantee had murdered 200
girls, for the purpose of using their blood to mix
with the mortar employed in the building of a
new palace.</p>

<p>A foundation sacrifice is suggested by the
following curious discovery, reported in the <cite>Yorkshire
Herald</cite> of May 31st, 1895: “It was recently
ascertained that the tower of Darrington Church,
about four miles from Pontefract, had suffered
some damage during the winter gales. The
foundations were carefully examined, when it
was found that under the west side of the tower,
only about a foot from the surface, the body of a
man had been placed in a sort of bed in the solid
rock, and the west wall was actually resting upon
his skull. The gentle vibration of the tower had
opened the skull and caused in it a crack of
about two-and-a-half inches long. The grave
must have been prepared and the wall placed
with deliberate intention upon the head of the person
buried, and this was done with such care that
all remained as placed for at least 600 years.”</p>

<p><a name="p39" id="p39"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>39<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The majority of the clergy in the early part of
the Middle Ages doubtless would be very strongly
imbued with all the superstitions of the people.
The mediæval priest, half believing in many of
the old pagan customs, would allow them to
continue, and it is both curious and interesting
to notice how heathenism has for so long a period
lingered on, mixed up with Christian ideas.</p>

<p>It is said that St. Odhran expressed his willingness
to be the first to be buried in Iona, and,
indeed, offered himself to be buried alive for
sacrifice. Local tradition long afterwards added
the still more ghastly circumstance that once,
when the tomb was opened, he was found still
alive, and uttered such fearful words that the
grave had to be closed immediately.</p>

<p>Even at the present day there is a prejudice
more or less deeply rooted against a first burial
in a new churchyard or cemetery. This prejudice
is doubtless due to the fact that in early ages the
first to be buried was a victim. Later on in the
middle ages the idea seems to have been that the
first to be buried became the perquisite of the
devil, who thus seems in the minds of the people
to have taken the place of the pagan deity. Not
in England alone, but all over Northern Europe,
<a name="p40" id="p40"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>there is a strong prejudice against being the first
to enter a new building, or to cross a newly-built
bridge. At the least it is considered unlucky,
and the more superstitious believe it will entail
death. All this is the outcome of the once
general sacrificial foundation, and the lingering
shadow of a ghastly practice.</p>

<p>Grimm, in his “Teutonic Mythology,” tells us
that when the new bridge at Halle, finished in
1843, was building, the common people got an
idea that a child was wanted to wall up in the
foundations. In the outer wall of Reichenfels
Castle a child was actually built in alive; a
projecting stone marks the spot, and it is believed
that if this stone were pulled out the wall would
at once fall down.</p>

<p>Bones, both human and of animals, have been
found under hearthstones of houses. When we
consider that the hearth is the centre, as it were,
and most sacred spot of a house, and that the
chimney above it is the highest portion built, and
the most difficult to complete, it seems easy to
understand why the victim was buried under the
hearthstone or jamb of the chimney.</p>

<p>There is an interesting custom prevailing in
Roumania to the present day which is clearly a
<a name="p41" id="p41"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>remnant of the old idea of a sacrificial foundation.
When masons are engaged building a house they
try to catch the shadow of a stranger passing by
and wall it in, and throw in stones and mortar
whilst his shadow rests on the walls. If no one
passes by to throw a shadow the masons go in
search of a woman or child who does not belong
to the place, and, unperceived by the person,
apply a reed to the shadow and this reed is then
immured. In Holland frequently there has been
found in foundations curious looking objects
something like ninepins, but which in reality
are simply rude imitations of babies in their
swaddling bands&mdash;the image representing the
child being the modern substitute for an actual
sacrifice. Carved figures of Christ crucified have
been found in the foundations of churches.
Some few years ago, when the north wall of
Chulmleigh Church in North Devon was taken
down there was found a carved figure of Christ
crucified to a vine.<sup><a href="#fn4" name="fnm4" id="fnm4"
 title="go to footnote 4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A story is told that the walls of Scutari contain
the body of a victim. In this case it is a woman
who is said to have been built in, but an opening
was left through which her infant might be
<a name="p42" id="p42"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>passed in to be suckled by her as long as any life
remained in the poor creature, and after her
death the hole was closed.</p>

<p>The legend of Cologne Cathedral is well
known. The architect sold himself to the devil
for the plan, and gave up his life when the
building was in progress; that is to say, the man
voluntarily gave up his life to be buried under
the tower to ensure the stability of the enormous
superstructure, which he believed could not be
held up in any other way.</p>

<p>It is well known that the extinguished torch is
the symbol of departed life, and to the present
day the superstitious mind always connects the
soul with flame. It was at one time a common
practice to bury a candle in a coffin, the
explanation being that the dead man needed it
to give him light on his way to Heaven. It is
extremely doubtful, however, whether this was
the original idea, for most probably the candle
in the first instance really represented an extinguished
life, and was thus a substitute for a
human sacrifice which, in the pagan times,
accompanied every burial. The candle, in fact,
took the place of a life, human or animal, and
in many instances candles have been found
<a name="p43" id="p43"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>immured in the walls and foundations of churches
and houses.</p>

<p>Eggs have often been found built into foundations.
The egg had, of course life in it&mdash;but
undeveloped life, so that by its use the old belief
in the efficacy of a living sacrifice was fully
maintained without any shock to the feelings of
people in days when they were beginning to
revolt against the practices of the early ages.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott speaks of the tradition that
the foundation stones of Pictish raths were
bathed in human blood. In the ballad of the
“Cout of Keeldar” it is said:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:20em;">
<div class="stanza">
<div>   “And here beside the mountain flood</div>
<div class="i2"><span class="kindle">  </span>      A massy castle frowned;</div>
<div>    Since first the Pictish race, in blood,</div>
<div class="i2"><span class="kindle">  </span>      The haunted pile did found.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Thorpe’s “Northern Mythology” we
learn that in Denmark, in former days, before
any human being was buried in a churchyard, a
living horse was first interred. This horse is
supposed to re-appear, and is known by the
name of the “Hel-horse.” It has only three
legs, and if anyone meets it it forebodes death.
Hence is derived the saying when anyone has
survived a dangerous illness: “He gave death a
<a name="p44" id="p44"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>peck of oats” (as an offering or bribe). Hel is
identical with death, and in times of pestilence
is supposed to ride about on a three-legged horse
and strangle people.</p>

<p>The belief still lingers in Germany that good
weather may be secured by building a live cock
into a wall, and it is thought that cattle may be
prevented from straying by burying a living blind
dog under the threshold of a stable. Amongst
the French peasantry a new farmhouse is not
entered upon until a cock has been killed and its
blood sprinkled in the rooms.<sup><a href="#fn5" name="fnm5" id="fnm5"
 title="go to footnote 5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>It is probable that sacrificial foundations had
their origin in the idea of a propitiary offering to
the Goddess Earth. However this may be, it
is certain that for centuries, through times of
heathenism, and well into even advanced Christianity,
the people so thoroughly associated the
foundation of buildings with a sacrifice that in
some form or other it has lingered on to the
present century. Now in our own day the
laying the foundation of any important building
is always attended with a ceremony&mdash;the form
remains, the sacrifice is no longer offered. For
ecclesiastical buildings, or those having some
<a name="p45" id="p45"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>charitable object, a religious ceremony is provided,
while for those purely secular the event
is marked by rejoicings. We cannot bring ourselves
to pass over without notice the foundation
laying of our great buildings, and who shall
venture to say that superstition is altogether
dead, and that we are free from the lingering
remains of what was once the pagan belief?</p>

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">Of</span> all the sins of the nineteenth century,
the one which most militates against its
attainment of excellence in art is its impatience.
A work has been no sooner decided on, than
there is a clamour for its completion. Our
cathedrals were for the most part reared in
far other times, and are therefore admirable.
Growing with the stately, deliberate increase
of the ponderous oak, they speak of days when
art was original, sincere, patient, and therefore
capable of great deeds; original, not in extravagance
or eccentricity, but in the realization of
the natural development of style, advancing
from grace to grace, from the perfection of
solidity to the perfection of adornment, by an
unforced growth; sincere, in its confidence of its
own capacity for fulfilling its appointed end, in
its grasp of the possibilities in its materials, in its
choice of the true, rather than the easy, method
of working; and patient, finally, in its contentment
to do in each age a little solidly and well,
<a name="p47" id="p47"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>rather than a great deal indifferently, in its aim
at artistic perfection in preference to material
completeness. Thus it is that none of our
cathedrals are the work of one age, save those of
Salisbury and London, and even they have
details which they owe to succeeding times.</p>

<p>The above words are not intended to imply
that our mediæval builders made no mistakes.
The brief review of some of their work will show
us proof to the contrary; but the mistakes were
rare exceptions. If, for instance, a captious
critic turns to Peterborough, and points us to
the defective foundations, which have recently
required the rebuilding of the central tower, and
the supposed necessity of reconstructing the west
front, all that the case will prove is that our
great monastic architects’ work was not always
absolutely eternal. “So there was jerry-building
in those days too!” someone exclaims, with a
note of triumph at the dragging down of the
great ideals of the past to the level of the
paltriness of the present. If such be the case, we
reply, there were indeed giants in those days,
the very “jerry building” of which rides out
the storms of well-nigh seven centuries before
revealing any fatal weaknesses.</p>

<p><a name="p48" id="p48"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>48<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>In considering these splendid buildings, of
which the present century has happily proved
itself no unappreciative heir, it will be of interest
to devote a few lines to the means which were
employed to raise funds for their construction.
Several illustrations of the methods employed in
the case of cathedrals and other churches have
come down to us. The story of the foundation
of the new buildings at Crowland Abbey in 1112,
exhibits an outburst of popular enthusiasm which
irresistibly recalls the free gifts of the Hebrew
people for the building of the first temple. “The
prayers having been said and the antiphons
sung,” says Peter Blesensis, vice-chancellor
under Henry&nbsp;II., “the abbot himself laid the
first corner-stone on the east side. After him
every man according to his degree laid his stone;
some laid money, others writings by which they
offered their lands, advowsons of livings, tenths
of sheep and other church tithes; certain
measures of wheat, a certain number of workmen
or masons, etc. On the other side, the
common people, as officious with emulation
and great devotion, offered, some money, some
one day’s work every month till it should be
finished, some to build whole pillars, others
<a name="p49" id="p49"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>pedestals, and others certain parts of the walls.”</p>

<p>Indulgences, remitting so many days’ penance,
were sometimes issued to encourage the gifts of
the faithful. Thus in the time of Henry&nbsp;VIII. a
church brief was issued soliciting help towards
the repair of Kirby Belers Church, in Leicestershire,
part of which runs as <span class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span>“Also
certayne patriarkes, prymates, &amp;c., unto the
nombre of sixtie-five, everie one of theym
syngularly, unto all theym that put their helpyng
handes unto the sayd churche, have granted
xl dayes of pardon; which nombre extendeth
unto vij yeres and cc dayes, <i>totiens quotiens</i>.”
Sometimes, by way of penance itself, a fine was
imposed, which was devoted to a local building
fund. Gilbert, bishop of Chichester, in certain
constitutions promulgated in 1289 rules that
every priest in the diocese who shall be convicted
of certain scandalous sins shall “forfeit
forty shillings, to be applied to the structure of
Chichester Cathedral.” In modern money this
fine would amount to something like £40.
Walter, Bishop of Worcester, also ordained in
1240 that beneficed priests who dressed unclerically
should be fined to the extent of a tenth
of their annual revenue for the benefit of the
<a name="p50" id="p50"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>building of his cathedral. A yet earlier order
concerning laity as well as clergy was issued by
the Witan at Engsham, in Oxfordshire, in the
year 1009, which decides that “if any pecuniary
compensation shall arise out of a mulct for sins
committed against God, this ought to be applied,
according to the discretion of the bishop,” to one
of several pious purposes, of which two are “the
repair of churches, and the purchase of books,
bells, and ecclesiastical vestments.”</p>

<p>Another way of raising money was to exact a
contribution from church dignitaries, as a kind
of “entrance fee,” on their accepting preferment.
William Heyworth, bishop of Coventry, (a see
now owning Chester as its mother city), decreed
in 1428 that “every canon on commencing his
first residence should pay a hundred marks
towards the structure of the cathedral, the
purchase of ornaments,” and other similar
expenses.</p>

<p>In 1247, Bishop Ralph Neville, of Chichester,
having died indebted to some of the canons of
the cathedral, left by will a sufficient sum to
discharge his obligations. But these ecclesiastical
creditors decided that it should be devoted
to “the completion of a certain stone tower,
<a name="p51" id="p51"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>which had remained for a long time unfinished.”
The same canons bitterly complained because
the Pope had ordained that all vacant prebends
throughout the country should remain unoccupied
for a year, in order that their revenues
might be devoted to the erection of the minster
at Canterbury; whereas they not unnaturally
felt that the needs of their own cathedral had
the first claim upon them.</p>

<p>Those churches which contained the shrines
of popular saints drew, for the repair or enlargement
of the fabric, no small revenue from the
offerings of pilgrims. The eastern part of
Rochester Cathedral was paid for by the moneys
deposited at the tomb of S.&nbsp;William of Perth;
and the large sums given by visitors to the
shrine of S.&nbsp;Thomas of Canterbury materially
assisted in keeping the building in repair.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the sums needed for rearing
these massive piles were in most cases given,
either in money or in kind, by the faithful;
sometimes the princely offerings of a few wealthy
men, sometimes the countless small gifts of the
multitude, have become transmuted into tapering
spire, or ponderous tower, “long-drawn aisle
and fretted vault.” The poor, in some instances,
<a name="p52" id="p52"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>as we have seen, voluntarily gave their labour;
in others the hands of the monks themselves
raised and cut the sculptured stones.</p>

<p>In most cases the cathedrals which we now
possess are not the first that have occupied their
sites. Some humble building, often reared by
one of the pioneers of the faith, was in the
majority of instances the shrine that first consecrated
the spot to the service of God.</p>

<p>It was in 401, during the visit of Germanus
and Lupus, bishops of Auxerre and of Troyes,
to aid in exterminating the Pelagian heresy, that
the earliest shrine of S.&nbsp;Alban, a simple wooden
oratory, was erected at Verulam; S.&nbsp;Deiniol built
a little stave-kirk, or timber church, at Bangor
about 550; and Kentigern, some ten years
later, raised the first religious establishment at
Llanelwy, or S.&nbsp;Asaph; while where now the
ruined Cathedral of Man rears its weather-beaten
gables and sightless windows at Peel, tradition
says S.&nbsp;Patrick consecrated S.&nbsp;Germain first
bishop of the Southern Isles in 447.</p>

<p>Many causes, however, combined to sweep
away not only all traces of these earliest
churches, but also in many instances more than
one more solidly constructed successor. The
<a name="p53" id="p53"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>growth of architectural taste and skill made men
impatient of the rudeness of their forefathers’
simple fanes; in a surprising number of instances
the lightning-flash or the raging fire destroyed
the buildings wholly or in part. The cathedrals
of the north felt more than once the shock of
the Border wars; and civil strife, or religious
fanaticism, wrought mischief in many others.
Thus it has come to pass that the centuries have
seen four cathedrals in succession at Hereford,
at Gloucester, and at Bangor; and three at a
multitude of places, Canterbury, London, Winchester,
Peterborough, Lichfield, Oxford, and
half-a-dozen more.</p>

<p>The incursions of the Danes were answerable
for the destruction of several of the earlier
foundations. Canterbury had a cathedral, the
most ancient part of which had been erected,
according to tradition, by Lucius, the first
Christian King of the Britons, and afterwards
restored by S.&nbsp;Augustine. To this, about the
year 740, Cuthbert, the archbishop, added a
chapel for the interment of the occupants of the
see; and Odo, in the tenth century, enlarged and
re-roofed it. But in the days of saintly Alphege,
in 1005, the Danish invaders fell upon the city,
<a name="p54" id="p54"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>making of the church a ruin, and of its bishop a
martyr. A similar fate befell the metropolitan
church of the north. On the site where Paulinus
baptized King Edwin and his two sons into the
Christian faith a little wooden oratory was
raised, over which ere long Edwin commenced
to build a stone church, which S.&nbsp;Oswald, his
successor, completed. This, after having been
beautified by S.&nbsp;Wilfred, was burnt about 741,
but re-built shortly afterwards by Archbishop
Egbert. It was this latter building which fell
before the Danes.</p>

<p>At Ely the religious house founded by
S.&nbsp;Etheldreda, which was the precursor of the
modern cathedral, was burnt by the same
marauders about 870. Rochester suffered in the
same way; and no trace of the church built, so
says the Venerable Bede, by King Ethelbert
himself now remains. Peterborough has been
particularly unfortunate in this respect. The
first building here was begun by Peada, King of
Mercia, in the seventh century. In the year 870
the Danes, on one of their forays, burnt church
and monastery to the ground, and massacred the
abbot and all his monks. In 971 King Edgar
raised the place once more from its desolation,
<a name="p55" id="p55"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>but again it was seriously damaged, though not
absolutely destroyed, by the sea-kings shortly
before the Norman Conquest. Oxford was
partially burnt in 1002 owing to the same people,
but in a different way. A number of Danes took
refuge in the tower of S.&nbsp;Frideswide to escape
the senseless and brutal massacre organised on
S.&nbsp;Brice’s day in that year, and the English fired
the structure rather than suffer their prey to
escape them.</p>

<p>It will be convenient here, although it may
take us in some cases away from those primitive
foundations which so far we have considered, to
glance at the other instances in which war has
left its mark upon our cathedrals. Hereford,
lying near the Welsh border, felt the storm and
stress of warfare in 1056. Originally founded at
some unknown date in very early English times,
the church at Hereford was rebuilt about 830 by
a noble Mercian, named Milfrid, and was
repaired, if not actually renewed, by Athelstan
the bishop, who came to the see in 1012. Ten
years before the Norman Conquest, however,
Griffith, prince of Wales, at the head of a
combined host of Welsh and Irish, crossed the
marches and plundered and burnt the church
<a name="p56" id="p56"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and city. In the reign of Hardicanute (1039&ndash;1041)
the citizens of Worcester, having risen
against the payment of the ship-tax, were severely
punished, a military force being sent to
occupy their city. So thoroughly did it carry
out the work of inflicting discipline on the
malcontents, that the church, amongst other
buildings, was left in ruins. The original church
at Gloucester was built in 681, as part of a
conventual establishment; this was destroyed,
and, after an interval, rebuilt by Beornulph,
King of Mercia, sometime previous to 825.
This church was looted by the Danes, but
restored by S.&nbsp;Edward the Confessor. In the
year after the Conquest, Gloucester was occupied
by the Normans, whose entrance was not, however,
accepted quite peaceably by the citizens;
and in the tumult the Cathedral was seriously
injured by the one or the other party. Exeter
provides us with another case. Here was a
cathedral in early English days, which lasted
until the time of Bishop William Warelwast,
who began the erection of a new one in 1112.
During the stormy reign of Stephen, the city was
held for Matilda and had to stand a siege by
the King, to the great damage of the still
<a name="p57" id="p57"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>unfinished church. To quote one further
illustration only: Bangor, whose wooden church
was replaced by a stone one somewhere about
1102, suffered grievously in the wars waged
between Henry&nbsp;III. of England, and David,
Prince of Wales, an episode in which was the
destruction of the Cathedral.</p>

</div>

<p>The conquest of England by William, Duke
of Normandy, had a vast influence on the
ecclesiastical buildings of the country. On the
continent art had advanced at a pace unknown
in this island, and the plain and massive
churches scattered over the land must have
seemed very rude structures in the eyes of the
prelates who came in the victor’s train.
S.&nbsp;Edward the Confessor, with his Norman predilections,
had no doubt accustomed his courtiers
to some aspects of foreign art, and through his
influence the so-called Norman architecture
preceded the Normans in the country; but
such instances of it as were to be seen must
have been few, and probably confined to the
southern counties.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Conqueror’s throne been
secured before his countrymen, placed in the
abbeys and sees of England, began to rebuild, on
<a name="p58" id="p58"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>new and grander plans, the churches under their
charge.</p>

<p>Lanfranc, who ascended the throne of S.&nbsp;Augustine
in 1070, set himself to the work of
rebuilding Canterbury Cathedral, not contenting
himself with any enlargement or embellishment
of the older fane, but making a clean sweep of
that, and beginning from the foundations. S.
Anselm, and the prior of the monastery,
Ernulph, took up the work and enlarged upon
Lanfranc’s design, pulling down and re-building
the choir. Early in the next century, namely in
1130, the new Cathedral, completed under the
supervision of Conrad, successor to Ernulph,
was solemnly dedicated with great pomp in the
presence of the Kings of England and of Scotland.</p>

 /><small>RIPON CATHEDRAL.</small>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Thomas of Bayeux, who became
Archbishop of York in the same year as that in
which Lanfranc obtained his English see, was
busy rebuilding his Minster at York. William
of Carilef commenced the magnificent pile,
forming one of the finest Norman churches in
existence, which crowns the Wear at Durham,
in 1093; and Ralph Flambard took up the work
three years later, completing it in 1128. London
<a name="p61" id="p61"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>was deprived of its Cathedral by fire probably
about 1088, and the work of restoration was at
once undertaken by Maurice, its Norman bishop.
In 1079 Bishop Walkelyn began the erection of
a cathedral church at Winchester, in the place
of the old Saxon building which had first been
founded on the conversion of King Cynegils,
about 635. In all parts of the land, east and
west, north and south, the builders were at work,
rearing massive temples to the glory and honour
of God. The chink of chisel and the blow of
hammer rang everywhere in the ears of the
eleventh century in England. Bishop Herbert
Losinga laid the first stone of Norwich Cathedral
in 1096, at which time Remigius of Fescamp
had been some twenty years at work on that of
Lincoln, and had passed away, leaving the completion
to others. The new Norman Cathedral
of Hereford was begun by Robert Losinga, who
reigned as bishop from 1079 to 1096. Abbot
Simeon began to build the Minster at Ely about
1092; Worcester was commenced by Wulfstan
in 1084; five years later the foundation of
Gloucester was laid; and in 1091 S.&nbsp;Osmund
consecrated the church of S.&nbsp;Nicholas at Newcastle.
Other cathedrals which were built, or
<a name="p62" id="p62"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>rebuilt, at about the same date include those of
Carlisle, S.&nbsp;Albans, Rochester, Chester, Lichfield
and Oxford.</p>

<p>Surely never was an age so enthusiastic in
building! All these cathedrals, many still
remaining largely as their Norman builders left
them, most retaining many relics of their work,
were commenced within the space of two reigns
of by no means great duration, lasting only from
1066 to 1100.</p>

<p>The energy of the time was not, however,
exhausted by the fervour of this outburst. The
twelfth century took up and vigorously prosecuted
the tasks handed on to it by the eleventh.</p>

 <img src="images/p63.jpg" alt="" id="img63" /><br
 /><small>SOUTHWELL MINSTER.</small>
</div>

<p>Among cathedrals which were entirely, or
almost entirely, rebuilt during this century
we have Chichester, Rochester, Peterborough,
Lincoln, Oxford, Bristol, Southwell, S.&nbsp;David’s,
Llandaff, and Ripon. In the first of these a
great part of the work was done twice over
within this period. Ralph de Luffa was bishop
of the see when the cathedral was consecrated
in 1108; two fires, however, did such serious
damage to this building, the first in 1114, and
the second in 1186, that it had practically to be
re-constructed, and was re-dedicated in the year
<a name="p65" id="p65"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>1199. The Cathedral at Rochester was largely
re-built by John of Canterbury between 1125
and 1137, and like Chichester suffered twice
during the century from the ravages of fire.
Indeed, so frequently do we find mention of
conflagrations in the cathedrals in the early
mediæval days, that it is quite obvious that
William&nbsp;I. was fully justified in taking such
precautions against this enemy as the use of the
curfew involved. In more than one instance the
cathedral went up in flames as part only of a fire
which destroyed a large portion of the town.</p>

<p>The undertaking of new work at Peterborough
was the result of a similar cause. In the year
1116 fire destroyed almost the whole church and
monastery, but in two years’ time the re-erection
had commenced, and was continued throughout
the remainder of the century. The choir was
ready for the resumption of the Divine offices in
1143, but the builders did not reach the end of
their labours until 1237. Re-construction was
necessitated at Lincoln by the occurrence of an
earthquake in 1185, following once more upon a
fire which took place in 1141. The stone
vaulting and the western towers were undertaken
by Alexander, bishop from 1123 to 1147; and in
<a name="p66" id="p66"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>1192 S.&nbsp;Hugh of Avalon, who held the see from
1186 to 1203, began a thorough re-building of
the pile. This work marks an epoch in the
progress of architecture in England, as in the
choir of S.&nbsp;Hugh we meet with the earliest
examples of the use of the lancet form of arch
to which we can assign a known date. About
the middle of this century a new church, not yet
advanced to the dignity of a cathedral, was
commenced at Oxford, and by the year 1180 it
was sufficiently advanced to allow of the translation
of the relics of S.&nbsp;Frideswide to their
new shrine. In 1142 was founded the Abbey of
Bristol, and its church was consecrated on
Easter Day, 1148, although the completion of
the buildings occupied the attention of the
abbots for many years after. Southwell Minster
was also building during the first half of the
twelfth century; Peter de Leia, who became
Bishop of S.&nbsp;David’s in 1176, commenced the
erection of his cathedral four years later, following
the example of Arban, who entered upon the
neighbouring see of Llandaff in 1107, and reared
a mother church for his diocese. Finally, Ripon
also saw the masons busily at work almost
through the century. First Thurstan,
<a name="p67" id="p67"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Archbishop of York in 1114, began the enlargement
of the Abbey Church, and after him Archbishop
Roger (1154&ndash;1181) entirely rebuilt it.</p>

<p>But the record of the churches re-built during
this century by no means exhausts the tale of
work performed during that time. At Winchester,
for example, in 1107 the central tower fell,
necessitating the building of a new one. Lucy,
bishop here from 1189 to 1205, erected a new
Lady Chapel and made other alterations. At
Hereford, too, operations were going forward
almost throughout the century, the bishops
Reynelm (1107&ndash;1115) and Betun (1131&ndash;1148)
being especially energetic in pressing them on;
and the closing years of this period saw the
rearing of the eastern transepts. At this time
also the beautiful Galilee Chapel was added to
Durham Cathedral; Ely was consecrated in
1106, and towards the end of the century
received its central tower and other additions;
and S.&nbsp;Albans, moreover, had a façade built on
its western front by John de&nbsp;Cella.</p>

<p>The chronicle of the damages by fire during
the twelfth century is not complete without
mentioning that S.&nbsp;Paul’s, London, which was
re-building during a large portion of that time,
<a name="p68" id="p68"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>was injured by it in 1136; and the same foe
destroyed the roof of Worcester Cathedral in the
early days of the century.</p>

<p>The period which our rapid survey has so far
covered embraces broadly the eras of the Norman
and of the so-called Early English architecture.
In the thirteenth century the Decorated Style
came into being, and with its rise arose also the
desire for greater richness of ornament even in
those churches which had already, to all appearances,
been completed. On all hands, therefore,
in this new century, we find the pulling down
of portions of the stern Norman work and the
substitution of lighter and more graceful designs.</p>

<p>The great work of the thirteenth century,
however, was begun before the birth of the more
florid style, and shows little trace of the dawning
of its influence. Salisbury Cathedral was begun
in 1220, the work commencing, as was usual, at
the eastern end and advancing westward. The
whole was proceeded with continuously, and
since its completion no alteration of any importance
has been made in it. Other cathedrals in
England exhibit in almost every case a conglomerate
of several orders of architecture,
blended generally with great skill, but necessarily
<a name="p69" id="p69"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>lacking to some extent in unity of design in consequence.
In Salisbury we have one complete
and splendid example of English architecture of
the best period, carried out from beginning to
end with unbroken unity of purpose.</p>

<p>Other churches which then were, or were
subsequently to become, cathedrals, dating in
their present form from the thirteenth century,
are those of Lichfield, Wells, Manchester,
Bangor, and S.&nbsp;Asaph.</p>

<p>A Norman church had been reared at Lichfield
of which very few relics have survived to
the present day, a new building having been
begun about the year 1200, and the work of
construction carried on for the major part of the
century, the west front being reached about
1275. Bishop Joceline was the chief founder of
the existing Cathedral at Wells, most of the
previous work having been taken down in his
time, and the new church solemnly dedicated by
him in 1239. The Church at Manchester was
probably built about 1220, but the present
building is of a later date. The Cathedral at
S.&nbsp;Asaph suffered from the great mediæval
enemy of such foundations, fire, twice during
this period. On the first occasion, in 1247, the
<a name="p70" id="p70"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>troops of Henry&nbsp;III. of England must be held
responsible for the destruction wrought; on the
second, in 1282, the outbreak was probably
accidental. Repairs, if not actual rebuilding,
took place in consequence of these injuries
towards the end of the century. Bangor
Cathedral was probably also rebuilt about 1291.</p>

<p>Fire played its old part throughout the
century in providing work for the ecclesiastical
masons, in other instances besides that referred
to in the Welsh diocese. The choir at Carlisle
was rebuilt probably about 1250 and the following
years, but had scarcely been fully completed
before it fell in a fire which destroyed a large
portion of the city. In 1216, S.&nbsp;Nicholas,
Newcastle, was almost destroyed by the same
fatal agency. Worcester Cathedral was again
burnt in 1202, and was rebuilt between then and
1218 sufficiently to be re-dedicated; although
the retro-choir, the choir, the Lady Chapel, and
some details were added at a later time in the
same century.</p>

<p>Imperfections in the work of the preceding age
were answerable for a certain amount of loss and
consequent re-construction (not seldom actually
a gain) in this. At Lincoln, for instance, the
<a name="p71" id="p71"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>central tower fell in 1237, and was replaced by
the present one, which has been described as
one of the finest in Europe. The east end of
Ripon had to be rebuilt owing to the structure
giving way in 1280; and in consequence again
of the fall of the tower, repairs had to be undertaken
at S.&nbsp;David’s in 1220.</p>

<p>The popular regard for Hugh, the sainted
bishop of Lincoln, led to the building of one of
the most beautiful sections of that Minster,
namely the Angel-choir, erected as a worthy
chapel for the shrine of S.&nbsp;Hugh, between 1255
and 1280. At Hereford, the Lady Chapel was
built about the middle of this century; and at
Ely, the presbytery and retro-choir at about the
same date; at Bristol, the elder Lady Chapel
probably a little earlier; at Southwell, the choir
between 1230 and 1250; and the choir also at
S.&nbsp;Albans, in 1256.</p>

<p>Several of our cathedral towers, moreover,
besides that at Lincoln, date from the thirteenth
century. York, S.&nbsp;Paul’s, Chichester and
Gloucester, all had the towers erected during
this period.</p>

<p>Passing on to the fourteenth century, we meet
with the same wide-spread activity, but it is
<a name="p72" id="p72"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>expended now rather in additions and embellishments
to existing buildings than in actual
re-constructions. At Ripon, the Cathedral was
partially burnt by the Scots in 1319, and later in
the century the tower was struck by lightning.
At S.&nbsp;Alban’s, part of the nave fell in 1323, as
did the tower at Ely in 1322. In each of these
cases repairs were of course rendered needful.
More important works were the rebuilding of the
nave and transepts at Canterbury at the end of
the century (1378&ndash;1410), the erection of the
Zouche Chapel at York about 1350, the addition
of both the central and the western towers to
Wells, the spires to Peterborough, and the
towers also to Hereford.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century is specially marked by
the growing popularity of chantries and side
chapels. We find them erected at this time at
Hereford and elsewhere; but little building on
a large scale is done. In several cases the
vaulting of the roofs dates from this period, and
a good deal of internal carving in wood or stone
was also done. Among the latter we may note
the high altar screen at S.&nbsp;Alban’s, and the
stalls at Carlisle and Ripon. Of the former
work, reference may be made to the vaulting
<a name="p73" id="p73"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of part of the choir and transepts at Norwich.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century is not a pleasant one to
contemplate in connection with our ancient
cathedrals. Ignorance and fanaticism were then
beginning to show themselves in their treatment
of the miracles of art bequeathed to the ages,
and soon became more obvious than culture or
reverence. This century saw the nave of Bristol
taken down, the spires removed from the towers
of Ripon, and other precautions against a threatened
collapse; but steps were not taken to repair
the losses thus caused. And in view of the nameless
horrors perpetrated within the hallowed walls
of churches and cathedrals, first by the extreme
reformers, and in the next century by the Puritans,
in the name of religion, it is only wonderful that
so much that is beautiful still survives.</p>

<p>The one constructive work of the seventeenth
century was, of course, the building of the
Cathedral of London, S.&nbsp;Paul’s, in the place of
that “Old S.&nbsp;Paul’s” which perished in the fire
of 1666. This building shares with Salisbury
the credit of complete unity, but is unique
among English Cathedrals in being classical in
style. However much more admirable the
Gothic style may be admitted to be for
<a name="p74" id="p74"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>ecclesiastical purposes, probably all will admit that the
grandeur of St. Paul’s grows upon one the more
familiar one becomes with it; and certainly no
tower, or collection of towers, could possibly
dominate a vast city like London in the way
that Wren’s splendid dome does.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century witnessed, among
other things, the removal of most of the spires
which down to that time had crowned the towers
of many of the cathedrals. Such was the case
with Hereford and Wakefield; the same thing
was attempted at Lincoln in 1727, but popular
tumult saved the spires; only, however, until
1807, when they were removed.</p>

<p>Of one work of construction the eighteenth
century was also guilty; the year 1704 gave birth
to that abortion among English cathedrals known
as S.&nbsp;Peter’s, Liverpool; with which, for nearly
twenty years, the population of one of the
wealthiest cities in the empire has been
content! Something in the way of restoration
was attempted in this century, but it was for the
most part done ignorantly, and no small part of
the restoration of the nineteenth century has
consisted in undoing so far as possible the work
of the eighteenth.</p>

<p><a name="p75" id="p75"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>75<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The present century has seen the commencement,
on noble lines, of the Cathedral of Truro;
and the beautifying of not a few of our old
minsters, which had been stript almost bare by
the destroyers of past times. Happily, the
guardians of these treasures of art and devotion
have for the most part been conscious of the
greatness of their trust, and the fabrics have
been dealt with reverently and with judgment.
Amongst others, Bristol, Chichester, St. Albans,
and Peterborough have required more or less
extensive measures of re-building.</p>

<p class="author">By the Rev. J. H. Stamp.</p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">The</span> sacred buildings designated by this
title were dedicated to the service of God,
in mediæval times, in honour of the Mother of
our Lord. The veneration of S.&nbsp;Mary, the
Blessed Virgin, had been growing up in the
Church from the fifth century, when the reality
of the incarnation of the Son of God was first
called into question by men who professed and
called themselves Christians. The defence of
the true doctrine brought clearly into view the
high dignity which God had conferred on the
humble maiden of Nazareth, and so reverence
for her memory, as the most blessed among
women, grew into veneration for her person as
the Mother of God. The faithful of the Middle
Ages were, therefore, not content with simply
retaining her name at the head of the list of
saints, but raised the human mother to a position
which was almost, if not quite, equal to that of
her Divine Son. They conferred on her the
title of “Our Lady,” and hailed her as “The
<a name="p77" id="p77"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Queen of Heaven,” just as they were accustomed
to address the Saviour as “Our Lord” and
worship Him as “The King of Heaven.” This
title still survives in the terms which are so
familiar to us, namely, “Lady Day” and “Lady
Chapel.”</p>

<p>We see evidences of this growth of the
<i>cultus</i> of the Blessed Virgin in the erection
and elaborate ornamentation of Lady Chapels
throughout Christendom. It does not seem
probable, however, that our pious forefathers in
the ancient Church of England intended to
encourage Mariolatry, by the introduction of
these buildings into this country; for it is a
singular and significant fact that in Spain, where
this heretical and superstitious practice chiefly
prevailed, Lady Chapels are very rare, because
the church itself has been made to serve the
purpose. English Churchmen, in their desire to
honour the Mother of Christ, were careful to
avoid this evil example. The erection of smaller
buildings, and the setting apart, for the purpose,
of one of the side aisles rather than the sanctuary
itself, tend to show that they did not assign to
the Blessed Virgin that <em>divine</em> honour which was
due only to her Son and Lord. The usual
<a name="p78" id="p78"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>position of the Lady Chapel, beyond the choir,
has, indeed, been considered as a proof that the
honour paid to “Our Lady” exceeded that
which was rendered unto our Lord, since the
altar dedicated to her was set up beyond the
High Altar in the most sacred portion of the
church, and, in that position, might be said to
overshadow it. But the usual situation of the
Lady Chapel, at the east end of the choir or
presbytery, proves nothing of the kind. One
celebrated writer on the subject disclaims the
idea in the following words, “Poole principally
objects to the position of the Lady Chapel at the
east end, ‘above,’ as he expresses it ‘the High
Altar.’ Now we believe the Lady Chapel to have
occupied the place merely on grounds of convenience,
and not from any design&mdash;which is
shocking to imagine&mdash;of exalting the Blessed
Virgin to any participation in the honours of the
Deity.”<sup><a href="#fn6" name="fnm6" id="fnm6"
 title="go to footnote 6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>It is true that the Lady Chapel was generally
erected at the extreme east end, or one of the
aisles near the choir was used for the purpose,
because it was considered the most sacred part
of the church next to the sanctuary. It was
<a name="p79" id="p79"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>erected at the east end of the Abbey Churches of
Westminster and S.&nbsp;Albans; in the Cathedral
Churches of Winchester, Salisbury, Chichester,
Exeter, Gloucester, Worcester, Wells, Hereford,
Chester and Manchester; at Christ Church,
Hants, where there is a chantry above, called
S.&nbsp;Michael’s Loft, which once served as the
Chapter House of the Priory, but in modern
times has been converted into a schoolroom;
and also at the parish church of S.&nbsp;Mary
Redcliffe, Bristol, where it is situated over a
thoroughfare, after the example of several
churches in Exeter. But the ecclesiastics and
architects of the Middle Ages did not consider
themselves bound, by a hard and fast rule, to set
up the Lady Chapel at the east end. If an
available site could be found beyond the Choir
the Chapel was erected in that position, otherwise,
the north aisle of the Church, or a
convenient site near the Choir, was utilised for
the purpose. The building has been erected on
the north or south side of the Choir or Nave, and
even at the west end when deemed expedient. It
was erected on the <em>north</em> side at the Cathedrals
of Canterbury, Oxford, Bristol, and Peterborough;
at the Abbeys of Glastonbury, Bury St.
<a name="p80" id="p80"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Edmunds, Walsingham, Thetford, Wymondham,
Belvoir, Llanthony, Hulme, and Croyland,
where there was a second Lady Chapel with a
lofty screen, in the south transept.<sup><a href="#fn7" name="fnm7" id="fnm7"
 title="go to footnote 7">7</a></sup> It is on the
<em>south</em> side at Kilkenny and at Elgin Cathedral.
It stands in a similar position over the Chapter
House at Ripon Minster. Sometimes it was
placed above the chancel, as in Compton
Church, Surrey; Compton Martin, Somerset;
and Darenth, Kent; or over the porch, as at
Fordham, Cambs. At Ely Cathedral it is
connected with the extremity of the north
transept. At Wimborne Minster it stands in
the south transept, whilst at Rochester Cathedral
and at Waltham Abbey, Essex, it was erected at
the west of the south transept. At Durham
Cathedral an attempt was made to build a Lady
Chapel at the east end, but owing, it is said, to
the supernatural intervention of S.&nbsp;Cuthbert,
whose relics were deposited in the Choir, the
building was erected instead at the west end,
where it stands under the name of the Galilee
Chapel. The original Lady Chapel at Canterbury
also stood in this unusual position, until the
days of Archbishop Lanfranc, 1070&ndash;1089, when
<a name="p81" id="p81"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>it was removed and the present building set up
at the east end. The <em>aisles</em> were also frequently
used as “ye Chappell of oure Ladye,” as at
Haddenham, Cambs.</p>

<p>The practice of dedicating Chapels to the
Blessed Virgin was introduced into this
country during the twelfth century, shortly
after the monastic orders had gained the
supremacy over the parochial clergy. These
buildings were generally founded not only to
satisfy the spirit of the age, which demanded
the veneration of the Mother of our Lord, but
also to afford the necessary accommodation at
the east end for the increased number of clergy.
The founders, moreover, hoped to secure an
augmentation of the revenues, by the offerings
of the faithful at the shrines of the new Chapels,
as appears to have been the case at Walsingham,
Norfolk; All Hallows, Barking; and S.&nbsp;Stephen’s,
Westminster. The building, in many
instances, became the depository of the relics of
a saint. The Galilee Chapel at Durham, dedicated
to S.&nbsp;Mary the Virgin in 1175, contains
the bones of the Venerable Bede, the earliest
historian of the Church of England, who died at
Jarrow-on-Tyne, on the eve of Ascension Day,
<a name="p82" id="p82"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span><span class="postnomial">A.D.</span>&nbsp;735. These relics were translated, in 1370,
from the tomb of S.&nbsp;Cuthbert, and placed in the
Chapel, in a magnificent shrine of gold and
silver. The Lady Chapel at Oxford contains
the shrine of S.&nbsp;Frideswide, the daughter
of the founder of the convent, and its first
prioress, whose relics were translated from the
north choir aisle in 1289. This Chapel is now
called the Dormitory, as the remains of several
deans and canons have been laid to rest within
its walls.</p>

<p>The Lady Chapel has frequently served as
the mausoleum of saints, princes, noblemen, and
dignitaries of the Church. The stately and
magnificent edifice at Westminster, known as
Henry the Seventh’s Chapel, was built for this
purpose in 1502, by the first Tudor monarch, on
the site of the original Lady Chapel, erected by
Henry&nbsp;III. in 1220. The royal founder, his
wife, and other royal personages now await the
resurrection in the tomb set up in this famous
building. The Lady Chapel at S.&nbsp;Mary’s,
Warwick, which is said to be the chief ornament
of that church, was also built as a tomb-house in
1443, by Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.
Their desire to rest in the chapel, dedicated to
<a name="p83" id="p83"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the blessed Virgin, was closely associated with
the idea which chiefly moved our forefathers to
erect these buildings. They had been taught to
believe in the invocation of saints, and were
anxious to secure, for themselves and their dear
ones, the mediation and intercession of the
Mother of our Lord, whose influence with her
Divine Son, they supposed, was all prevailing.
So they founded these chapels in her honour,
and solicited her good offices on their behalf by
frequent services and prostrations before her
image, which occupied the place of honour above
“oure Ladye’s Altar” crowned as the Queen of
Heaven, and profusely adorned with splendid
jewels and exquisite embroidery. They believed,
moreover, that as she could succour the living,
so she would prevail with her Son on behalf of
the dead. These sacred buildings were, accordingly,
used also as chantries, where masses were
offered daily, and the intervention of “oure Ladye
S.&nbsp;Mary” was solicited to secure the release of
the souls of the faithful departed from the flames
of purgatory, through which, it was supposed,
they must pass, to be purified from all the
defilements of their earthly course, and “made
meet for the inheritance of the saints in light.”
<a name="p84" id="p84"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>In frescoes on the walls, and in paintings on the
windows, the Virgin was represented, interceding
for the souls of the faithful as they came forth to
judgment.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of monasteries by Henry&nbsp;VIII.,
and the suppression of chantries by
Edward&nbsp;VI., many of these buildings shared the
fate of the conventual churches to which they
were attached. In some places the Lady Chapel
was left to decay, and disappeared in the course
of a few years, like that at Norwich, which fell
into a ruinous condition as early as 1569. In other
localities it was allowed to stand until the
turbulent days of the Commonwealth, as at
Peterborough, where it was taken down to
supply materials for the reparation of the
Cathedral, which had been greatly injured
by Cromwell’s soldiers. In several places it
was appropriated to other uses, and even
divested of its sacred character. The elegant
chapel at Ely, erected 1321&ndash;49, and said to
have been one of the most perfect buildings of
that age, was assigned at the Reformation to
the parishioners of Holy Trinity to serve as their
Parish Church, and is now called Trinity Church.
The splendid specimen at S.&nbsp;Albans was
<a name="p85" id="p85"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>separated from the presbytery by a public
thoroughfare, which was made through the antechapel,
and a charter of Edward&nbsp;VI. transferred
the sacred building to the authorities of the
ancient Grammar School, and it was used as a
schoolroom until the restoration in 1870. At
S.&nbsp;Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, the Lady Chapel has
also been used for scholastic purposes, and at
Waltham Abbey it has accommodated not only
parochial schools but public meetings and petty
sessions.</p>

<p>Among existing Lady Chapels, King Henry
the Seventh’s Chapel occupies the first place for
magnificence. The first Tudor monarch, in his
anxiety to make his peace with God before his
death, and to commemorate the union of the
houses of York and Lancaster, determined to
found a chapel in honour of the blessed Virgin,
“in whom,” he declares in his will, “hath ever
been my most singulier trust and confidence,
... and by whom I have hitherto in al
myne adversities ever had my special comforte
and relief.” He also made due provision for
the celebration of masses and the distribution of
alms “perpetually, for ever, while the world shall
endure” for the welfare of his soul. The laying
<a name="p86" id="p86"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of the foundation stone is recorded by the ancient
chronicler as follows: “On the 24th daie of
January 150⅔ a quarter of an houre afore three
of the clocke at after noone of the same daie,
the first stone of our Ladie Chapell, within
the monasterie of Westminster, was laid by
the hands of John Islip, Abbot of the same
monasterie ... and diverse others.”<sup><a href="#fn8" name="fnm8" id="fnm8"
 title="go to footnote 8">8</a></sup>
After its completion it was so universally
admired, that Leland the antiquary describes it
as “<i>orbis miraculum</i>”&mdash;the wonder of the world.
About fifty years after its dedication the services,
for which it was specially designed by its royal
founder, were brought to an end by the Act
of Parliament which suppressed the chantries
throughout the kingdom, and then followed three
centuries of gross neglect which reduced it to
“an almost shapeless mass of ruins,” as it was
described in 1803. Four years later, in 1807,
Dean Vincent obtained a parliamentary grant
for the restoration of the building, and the
necessary repairs were completed in 1822. The
Chapel still retains much of its ancient splendour,
and the elegant and elaborate ceiling is a marvel
of architectural skill. It has been used since the
<a name="p87" id="p87"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>year 1725 for the installation of the Knights of
the Bath, and their banners are suspended over
the old carved <i>misereres</i> or <i>misericordes</i> of the
monks.</p>

<p>“Ye Chappell of oure Ladye” at S.&nbsp;Alban’s is
also a most elegant specimen of the buildings,
dedicated to the blessed Virgin. The foundations
appear to have been laid by John de
Hertford, abbot from 1235 to 1260. But at the
election of Hugh de Eversdone, in 1308, the
walls had only reached the level of the underside
of the window sills, a height of ten feet above
the ground. During his rule he laboured so
assiduously to complete the work, that in a short
time he finished it. The building, at its dedication,
was so rich in detail that it is described by
ancient writers as “a magnificent sight.” The
work of Abbot Hugh included the exquisite
carvings in stone, which represent about seventy
different specimens of forms in nature. During
its use as a Grammar School, from 1553 to 1870,
the interior suffered much injury from the hands
of the schoolboys, and was allowed to fall into
a state of ruin and decay. Shortly after the
removal of the School in 1870, a restoration was
undertaken by the ladies of Hertfordshire, but
<a name="p88" id="p88"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>their good intentions were not carried into
effect, through lack of the necessary funds. Lord
Grimthorp then generously came to the rescue,
and through his munificence the Chapel has
been thoroughly and judiciously restored. It
now stands once more in all its glory, as a
perfect gem of architecture and one of the most
elegant Lady Chapels in Christendom.</p>

<p>“Ye Chappell of oure Ladye” at Waltham
Abbey is said to be one of the richest specimens
of mediæval architecture in Essex. The building
has been greatly defaced since the suppression
of chantries, but still bears traces of its original
glory. “The Lady Chapel,” says the late
Professor Freeman, “must have been a most
beautiful specimen of its style, but few ancient
structures have been more sedulously disfigured.”
It was erected before <span class="postnomial">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1292, as, during that
year, Roger Levenoth, an inhabitant, endowed
the chantry, with a house and 100 acres of land
in Roydon. The Chapel was in a flourishing
condition in the reign of Edward&nbsp;III., as we find
from the return made in obedience to the royal
order, which was issued to the master of the
ceremonies of every guild and chantry in the
King’s dominions. In the Court language of
<a name="p89" id="p89"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>that period, which was Norman French, Roger
Harrof and John de Poley, the chantry priests,
are described as “meisters de la petit compaignie
ordeigne al honor de Dieu et ure Donne seyncte
Marie en la Ville de Waltham seynte croice.”
The architect selected, as the site of the building,
the space formed by the easternmost bay of the
south aisle of the nave and the western side of
the south transept. This peculiar position
indicates that it was not the work of the monks,
but that of the parishioners, who were allowed
the use of the nave as their parish church from
the days of King Harold&nbsp;II., the founder. A
well-known antiquarian writes: “It seems to
have been built by the parishioners, and not by
the abbot and convent, and its position is due to
its occupying the only available spot, and where
only two walls wanted building. A similar case
occurs at Rochester. Where the Abbey built
the Lady Chapel it was usually east of the
transept&mdash;at the east end if there was room, at
the north side if otherwise.”<sup><a href="#fn9" name="fnm9" id="fnm9"
 title="go to footnote 9">9</a></sup> The parishioners
could not erect their Lady Chapel at the east
end, because the choir or presbytery had been
used as the monastic church from the days of
<a name="p90" id="p90"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Henry&nbsp;II., who, to atone for the massacre of
Thomas à Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury,
changed the secular foundation of Harold,
and introduced an abbot and monks of the
Augustinian order. Another Lady Chapel had
probably been erected at the east end for the use
of the monks, in accordance with the custom of
the age, but this shared the destruction which
befell the whole of the eastern portion of the
church after the dissolution of the monastery in
1540. The preservation of the parish Lady
Chapel is therefore due to its position at the
west of the presbytery. In a transcript by Peter
le Neve, Norroy King at Arms, 1698, it is stated
that a chapel was dedicated at Waltham in the
year 1188, by William de Vere, Bishop of
Hereford, “in honore Dei [et gloriosæ Virginis
Mariae] et B.&nbsp;Martyris atque pontificis Thomae
nomine.”<sup><a href="#fn10" name="fnm10" id="fnm10"
 title="go to footnote 10">10</a></sup> This has led to the conjecture that
reference is made to the existing building,<sup><a href="#fn11" name="fnm11" id="fnm11"
 title="go to footnote 11">11</a></sup> or
to that which formerly stood at the east end.<sup><a href="#fn12" name="fnm12" id="fnm12"
 title="go to footnote 12">12</a></sup>
But the original Waltham manuscript shows
that it does not refer to a Lady Chapel at all,
but to the Chapel of S.&nbsp;Thomas of Canterbury.<sup><a href="#fn13" name="fnm13" id="fnm13"
 title="go to footnote 13">13</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="p91" id="p91"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>91<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The masonry of the exterior of the two walls
erected when the Chapel was founded, consists
of alternating bands of stone, squared bricks,
and flint, so that it produces a “poly-chromatic
effect.”<sup><a href="#fn14" name="fnm14" id="fnm14"
 title="go to footnote 14">14</a></sup> There are three large buttresses of
considerable projection, with pedimented sets-off
and slopes, one being situated at the south-west
angle, and the other two on the south of the
building. Two smaller buttresses also occupy a
place on the south. Niches, with pedestals
for images, are still standing in the primary
buttresses.</p>

<p>The interior of the Chapel measures 41 feet
7&nbsp;inches in length, 23 feet in breadth, and 23 feet
in height. It is approached by a steep ascent of
nine long narrow stone steps, which are situated
near the south-west buttress. The ancient
doorway is beautifully decorated with ball flowers.
The floor stands at an elevation of nearly five
feet above the floor of the chancel, an arrangement
which appears to be peculiar to Waltham.
It was apparently built at this high level to add
to the loftiness of the crypt below, which was a
capacious chamber of much importance in olden
times, and consists of two wide bays of quadripartite
<a name="p92" id="p92"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>vaulting. There is no way of access from
the interior of the Church, but “the chapel is
connected with the south aisle by a single arch
of poor and ordinary architecture, a sad contrast
to the glorious Romanesque work of the nave.”<sup><a href="#fn15" name="fnm15" id="fnm15"
 title="go to footnote 15">15</a></sup>
At the west end there is a large and beautiful
six-light, square-headed window, with a rich and
peculiar arrangement of a double plane of tracery,
the inner plane consisting of three arches. This
window, and the four elegant windows of three
lights on the south side, are supposed to have
been filled with stained glass, like that of the
Chapter House at York Minster, and other
buildings of the same period. At the extreme
south-east of the building the remains of the
ancient sedilia and piscina may still be seen.
The walls were adorned with distemper paintings,
chocolate coloured vine-leaves on a yellow
ground running round the spandrels and
windows. This decoration probably included a
series of paintings, representing scenes in the life
of the Mother of our Lord, and concluding with
her assumption and coronation as the Queen of
Heaven. There was also a representation of the
Last Judgment in which “Our Lady” occupied
<a name="p93" id="p93"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the place of honour near her Divine Son and
Lord, interceding for the faithful as they
appeared before their Judge. On the removal of
the plaster from the east wall during the restoration
in 1875, the remains of a fresco of “the
Doom” were discovered, and here are depicted
the Judge of all mankind in the scarlet robes of
majesty, the Virgin as intercessor, S.&nbsp;Michael
the Archangel, presiding over the balances in
which souls are weighed, the Apostles as assessors,
bishops and abbots with the keys of S.&nbsp;Peter,
admitting the faithful into the Holy Catholic
Church, human forms emerging from the grave,
the path of life, the chains of everlasting darkness,
demons clothed in flames, and the jaws of
hell. The space under this fresco was probably
occupied by beautiful statuary, the image of
the blessed Virgin standing in the centre,
immediately above the altar of “Our Ladye.”
At the dissolution of the monastery “a table of
imagery of the xii. apostles,” belonging to this
Chapel, was valued at ten shillings. A few
fragments of statuary, supposed to have formed
part of this decoration, were discovered during the
restoration of the Abbey Church in 1860, and
have been inserted in the south-east wall of the
<a name="p94" id="p94"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>chancel. These relics of the splendid past
include the mutilated stone figures of four
saints, probably the evangelists, beautifully
carved, and a representation of the crucifixion
in black marble, but the ornament of precious
metal, with which it was adorned, has long
since disappeared.</p>

<p>The altars, desks, and tables in the Lady
Chapel were covered with plates of silver, as in
the crypt beneath, which was also, in those days,
a splendid chantry, served by its own priest,
who was called “the Charnel Priest.” The
sacramental vessels and plate, which were of
great value, were sold after the suppression.
Dr.&nbsp;Thomas Fuller, Incumbent of Waltham
Abbey in 1648, gives the following extracts from
the churchwarden’s accounts: “1549. <i>Imprimis.</i>&mdash;Sold
the silver plate which was on the desk in
the charnel, weighing five ounces, for twenty-five
shillings. Guess,” adds the historian, “the
gallantry of our church by this (presuming all
the rest in proportionable equipage) when the
desk whereon the priest read was inlaid with
plate of silver.” “1551. <i>Item.</i>&mdash;Received for
two hundred seventy-one ounces of plate, sold at
several times for the best advantage, sixty-seven
<a name="p95" id="p95"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>pound fourteen shillings and ninepence.”<sup><a href="#fn16" name="fnm16" id="fnm16"
 title="go to footnote 16">16</a></sup> The
inventory of goods made by order of Henry&nbsp;VIII.
also mentions “iiii. tables [of oure Ladye]
plated with sylver and gylte, every one of them
with ii. folding leves.” The Chapel was furnished
besides with “a lytell payre of organes,” valued
at xxs., at the dissolution of the monastery, when
Thomas Tallis, the father of English church
music, was organist of the Abbey Church, and
presided at the “greate large payre of organes”
in the Choir. He was assisted by John Boston,
of Waltham, who probably performed on the
smaller instrument in the Lady Chapel. Both
names are mentioned in the pension list, Tallis
receiving xxs. for wages and xxs. reward, and
Boston iiis. for wages and iiis. reward.</p>

<p>A large number of wax tapers and candles
was consumed annually at the various services
held in the Lady Chapel and Crypt. In the
return made by Sir Roger Harrop and Sir
John de Poley, masters of the two chantries in
the reign of Edward&nbsp;III., it is stated that every
man and woman in this guild paid a yearly
subscription of sixpence towards the expenses,
and at the feasts of “oure Ladye” all
<a name="p96" id="p96"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>“Christiens” of the company gave five burning
tapers (<i>tapres ardant</i>); in honour of our Lord
four large torches; and on other special occasions
fifteen tapers. Lights were also kept burning
during the solemn requiem and funeral services,
when prayers were offered that perpetual light
might shine upon the souls of the departed. It
is most likely that this impressive ceremonial
had been observed in both chantries, when the
body of Queen Eleanor rested for the night in
the Abbey Church on its way to Westminster,
and again when the remains of her royal consort,
Edward&nbsp;I., were deposited for three months
before the tomb of Harold. The wax in stock
for these memorial services at the suppression
was sold by the churchwardens as follows:
“<i>Item.</i>&mdash;Sold so much wax as amounts to twenty
six shillings.” Dr.&nbsp;Fuller remarks on this transaction,
“So thrifty the wardens that they
bought not candles and tapers ready made, but
bought the wax at the best hand and paid poor
people for the making of them. Now they sold
their magazine of wax as useless. Under the
Reformation more light and fewer candles.”<sup><a href="#fn17" name="fnm17" id="fnm17"
 title="go to footnote 17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>In the days of the chantry, lands, tenements,
<a name="p97" id="p97"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and other gifts were presented and bequeathed
that “obits” or prayers for the dead might be
offered before the altar and image of “oure
Ladye.” Dr. Fuller gives the following account
of “obits” at Waltham: “The charge of an obit
was two shillings and two pence; and, if any be
curious to have the particulars thereof, it was
thus expended: to the parish priest, three pence;
to our Lady’s priest, three pence; to the charnel
priest, threepence; to the two clerks, four pence;
to the children (these I conceive choristers) three
pence; to the sexton, two pence; to the bellman,
two pence; for two tapers, two pence; for
oblation, two pence. O, the reasonable rates at
Waltham! Two shillings and two pence for an
obit, the price whereof in S.&nbsp;Paul’s, in London,
was forty shillings! For, forsooth, the higher
the church, the holier the service, the dearer the
price, though he had given too much that had
given but thanks for such vanities. To defray
the expenses of these obits, the parties prayed
for, or their executors, left lands, houses, or
stock to the churchwardens.”<sup><a href="#fn18" name="fnm18" id="fnm18"
 title="go to footnote 18">18</a></sup> These obits were
abolished when the chantries were suppressed in
the first year of the reign of King Edward&nbsp;VI.
<a name="p98" id="p98"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>“Now,” says Dr. Fuller, “was the brotherhood
in the church dissolved, consisting as formerly of
three priests, three choristers, and two sextons;
and the rich plate belonging to them was sold for
the good of the parish. Superstition by degrees
being banished out of the church, we hear no
more of prayers and masses for the dead. Every
obit now had its own obit, and fully expired; the
lands formerly given thereunto being employed
to more charitable uses.”<sup><a href="#fn19" name="fnm19" id="fnm19"
 title="go to footnote 19">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Since the suppression both chantries have been
stripped of almost all their glory. The beautiful
statuary in the Lady Chapel has disappeared,
the decorated walls were covered with plaster,
the west window blocked up, three of the elegant
south windows were partly bricked up, and the
fourth was converted into a door-way. The
building was entirely separated from the Church
by a wall of lath and plaster, and the west front
obscured by the erection of an unsightly porch,
which also concealed from view the grand south
Norman entrance to the Abbey Church. The
exterior walls were covered with cement, in
imitation of classic rustic work. The Chapel
has been used during the last three centuries
<a name="p99" id="p99"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>for various purposes, some of which were
degrading in the extreme to its sacred character.
It has been used as a vestry, parochial
schoolroom and lending library, also for
public meetings and petty sessions, and, in its
darkest days, as a store-room. The crypt has
also passed through many changes, and has been
stripped of its original splendour. It retained
much of its beauty for a century after the
suppression, as Dr. Fuller writes during his
<span class="nw">incumbency:&mdash;</span>“To the south side of the Church
is joined a chapel, formerly our Lady’s, now a
school-house, and under it an arched charnel-house,
the fairest that I ever saw.”<sup><a href="#fn20" name="fnm20" id="fnm20"
 title="go to footnote 20">20</a></sup> This
beautiful chantry, which is partly underground,
has been used since as a sepulchre for the dead,
a prison cell for the living,<sup><a href="#fn21" name="fnm21" id="fnm21"
 title="go to footnote 21">21</a></sup> a receptacle for
human bones, a coal cellar and heating chamber.</p>

<p>The Lady Chapel resumed its sacred character
in 1876, after it had been carefully restored by
Sir T. Fowell Buxton, Bart., K.C.M.G.<sup><a href="#fn22" name="fnm22" id="fnm22"
 title="go to footnote 22">22</a></sup> whose
seat, Warlies Park, is situated in the parish.
The modern porch was removed from the west
end, the large arch in the south wall of the
<a name="p100" id="p100"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Church re-opened, and the five elegant windows
were made good. A splendidly carved memorial
screen has since been erected under the arch by
the parishioners, and some beautifully carved
altar rails set up at the east end. The arms of
the Abbey and Parish of Waltham Holy Cross
are represented on the screen, namely, two
angels exalting the Cross. The appearance of
the interior is, however, still mean and bare,
when compared with its former magnificence,
although so much has been done to rescue from
a state of degradation and neglect, this interesting
relic of mediæval times, “ye Chappell of
oure Ladye.”</p>

Some Famous Spires.</h2>

<p class="author">By John T. Page.</p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">It</span> is practically impossible to point to the
exact date when spires first assumed a place
in the category of ecclesiastical architecture.
They belong to the Gothic style, and like the
pointed arch were evolved rather than created.
The low pointed roof of the tower gradually gave
place to a more tapering finish, but the transition
was by no means progressive, and cannot be
clearly traced. Some of the earliest attempts at
spire-building were uncouth and ungraceful, and
even in these days the addition of a spire to a
modern church does not necessarily add to its
beauty. This is nearly always the case where
an undue regard is paid to ornamentation, either
at the base, or on the surface of the spire itself.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful spires are those
which at once spring clear from the summit of
the tower and gradually rise needle-like towards
the blue vault of heaven.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of our principal
<a name="p102" id="p102"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>spires date from the fourteenth century&mdash;a time
when spire-building appears to have reached the
zenith of its glory. Splendour and loftiness
combine to render the examples of this period
distinguished above those of any other.</p>

<p>Northamptonshire has been well termed the
county of “Squires and Spires,” and it is
probably within its borders that the largest
number of really beautiful spires may be found.
A journey from Northampton to Peterborough
along the Nene Valley is never to be forgotten
for the continually recurring spires which greet
the eye of the traveller at almost every point.
Rushden, Higham Ferrers, Irchester, Raunds,
Stanwick, Oundle, Finedon, Aldwinckle S.&nbsp;Peter’s,
Barnwell S.&nbsp;Andrew, and many others
all combine to render the term “Valley of
Spires” peculiarly appropriate to this district.</p>

<p>These spires of course cover a wide area.
The two finest groups of spires are those of
Coventry and Lichfield. When the cathedral
at Coventry, with its three spires, was in existence
in immediate proximity to the churches of
S.&nbsp;Michael’s and Holy Trinity, the group formed
“a picture not to be surpassed in England,” and
even now, with Christ Church added, the
<a name="p103" id="p103"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>“Ladies of the Vale,” of Lichfield, suffer
somewhat in comparison.</p>

<p>In point of height the cathedral spires of
Salisbury and Norwich hold their own, while for
beauty of outline Louth must be mentioned, and
for elaborateness of detail the spire of Grantham.</p>

<p>It now remains to give a cursory glance at
some of our most famous spires, and to endeavour
to enumerate some of their chief characteristics.</p>

<p>The spire of Salisbury Cathedral rises from
the centre of the main transept to a height of
410 feet. This is, without doubt, the tallest of
our English spires.<sup><a href="#fn23" name="fnm23" id="fnm23"
 title="go to footnote 23">23</a></sup> It is octagonal in shape,
and springs from four pinnacles. The surface is
enriched with three bands of quatre-foiled work,
and the angles are decorated throughout with
ball-flower ornament. From a storm in 1703 it
received some damage, and was, under the
direction of Sir Christopher Wren, braced with
ironwork. It does not appear to have moved
since then, but from experiments made in 1740
it was found to be out of the perpendicular 24½
inches to the south, and 16¼ inches to the west.
<a name="p104" id="p104"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>On the 21st of June, 1741, it was struck by lightning
and set on fire, but did not receive any great
damage, and in 1827, by means of an ingenious
wicker-work contrivance suspended from the top,
extensive repairs were carried out. The name
of the architect who conceived this lofty tower is
unknown, but the date of its erection was
probably at the beginning of the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>The spire of Norwich Cathedral rises to a
height of 315 feet, and on a clear day can be
seen for a distance of twenty miles. It was
probably built by Bishop Percy in the latter half
of the fourteenth century. About one hundred
years after, it was struck by lightning, but the
damage was speedily repaired. In 1629 the
upper part was blown down, and was re-built
in 1633.</p>

 <img src="images/p104a.jpg" alt="" id="img104a" /><br
 /><small>LOUTH CHURCH SPIRE.</small>
</div>

<p>The three spires of Coventry are those of
S.&nbsp;Michael’s, Holy Trinity, and Christ Church.
Of these, S.&nbsp;Michael’s is the chief, being 303 feet
high. Amongst parish churches, it is therefore
the tallest. The base consists of a lantern
flanked by four pinnacles, to which it is connected
by flying buttresses. Its erection was commenced
in the year 1373, and completed in 1394. At
<a name="p105" id="p105"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>105<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the restoration of the church, which took place
in 1885, the tower was found to have been
erected on the edge of an old quarry, and it cost
no less a sum than £17,000 to add a new foundation.
During the most critical period of the
work the structure visibly moved, and the apex
of the spire now leans 3ft. 5in. out of the
perpendicular towards the north-west.</p>

<p>Holy Trinity spire is 237 feet high, and much
less ornate than S.&nbsp;Michael’s. During a violent
tempest of “wind, thunder, and earthquake,”
which occurred<!-- TN: original reads "occured" --> on the 24th of January, 1665, it was
overthrown, and much injury was done to the
church in consequence. The re-building was
finished in 1668. It has been completely restored
in recent years.</p>

<p>The spire of Christ Church is some little
distance away from the other two. It is
octagonal in shape, and rises from an embattled
tower to a height of 230 feet. It was restored in
1888.</p>

<p>Lichfield Cathedral contains three spires
within its precincts. The grouping is, therefore,
more uniform than that of Coventry, although
the general effect is not thereby accentuated.
The central spire rises to a height of 258 feet,
<a name="p106" id="p106"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and the two which grace the west front are each
183 feet high. In the time of the great civil war,
when Lichfield was besieged, the central spire
was demolished. After the Restoration, it was
re-built by good old Dr.&nbsp;Hackett.</p>

<p>The spire of Chichester Cathedral, built in the
fourteenth century over a rotten sub-structure,
was destroyed by its own weight in 1861. It
was 271 feet high, and has now been re-built in
its original style on a slightly higher tower. The
story of its fall has often been told. On the
night of Wednesday, the 20th of February, 1861,
a heavy gale occurred. The next day, about
twenty minutes past one o’clock, the spire was
observed to suddenly lean towards the south-west,
and then to right itself again. Soon after,
it disappeared into the body of the cathedral,
sliding down like the folding of a telescope.
Only the coping-stone and the weather-vane fell
outside, the rest of the masonry formed a huge
cairn in the centre of the edifice, which was
practically cut into four portions by the wreck.
The present spire was completed in 1867.</p>

<p>In Lincolnshire there are two remarkable
spires at Louth and Grantham. The one at
Louth rises to a height of 294 feet. At the
<a name="p107" id="p107"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>corners of the tower are four tall turret pinnacles
to which the spire is connected by flying
buttresses. In 1843 it was struck by lightning;
steps were at once taken for its restoration,
which was completed three years later.</p>

<p>Grantham spire is octagonal in shape, and 285
feet in height. It is very light and graceful in
appearance, and is richly ornamented with
sculpture. It suffered from lightning in 1797,
and again in 1882. Since the latter date sixteen
feet of the masonry has been removed from the
summit and re-built.</p>

<p>The church of S.&nbsp;Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, has
been aptly termed by the poet Chatterton,
“the pride of Bristowe and the Western land.”
The spire rises to a height of 300 feet, and has
lately been restored at a cost of upwards of
£50,000. In 1445, during a storm, the greater
part of the original spire fell through the roof of
the church, and for about four centuries it
remained in a truncated state, although the
damage done to the interior was speedily
repaired.</p>

<p>The spire of S.&nbsp;Mary’s, Shrewsbury, is 220
feet high, and rises from an embattled tower,
the four corners of which contain crocketed
<a name="p108" id="p108"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>pinnacles. During a gale on the night of Sunday,
the 11th of February, 1894, about 50 feet of
the masonry of the spire crashed through the
church roof and did enormous damage. This
has, however, since been repaired. A memorial
stone on the west wall of the tower tells how
one Thomas Cadman, was killed on the 2nd of
February, 1739, when attempting to descend
from the spire by a rope.</p>

<p>For elaborateness of detail, the spire of S.
Mary the Virgin, Oxford, surpasses all others
in this country. Its apex is some 90 feet from
the ground, and around the base of the spire
clusters a mass of richly decorated pinnacles,
small spirelets, and canopies containing statues.
The effect is picturesque in the extreme, and
lends to the town of Oxford a unique charm. Its
conception dates from the fourteenth century,
but it has been much restored and added to
since.</p>

<p>Of the Northamptonshire spires, Oundle is the
loftiest, being 210 feet high. It bears date 1634,
but this evidently refers to a re-building. It was
partly taken down again and rebuilt in 1874. It
is hexagonal in shape, and the angles are
crocketed. Raunds church is surmounted by an
<a name="p109" id="p109"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>octagonal broach spire 186 feet high. It was
struck by lightning on the 31st of July, 1826, and
about 30 feet of the masonry was shattered.
This was at once rebuilt at a cost of £1,737 15s.
3d. The octagonal spire of Higham Ferrers is
170 feet high, and was rebuilt after destruction
by a storm of wind in 1632. Rushden spire is
an octagon 192 feet high, and richly crocketed.
At its base flying buttresses connect it with
pinnacles at the corners of the tower. The spire
at Finedon rises from an embattled tower to a
height of 133 feet; that of Stanwick is 156 feet
high, and that of Irchester 152 feet.</p>

<p>Space forbids more than a passing allusion to
the fine spires of Newcastle Cathedral, S.&nbsp;Mary
de Castro, Leicester, Ross, Herefordshire, and
Olney, Bucks. The latter rises to a height of
185 feet. At its summit is a weathercock which,
when taken down for regilding in 1884, was
found to contain the following <span class="nw">triplet&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="stanza">
<div>    I never crow,</div>
<div>    But stand to show</div>
<div>    Where winds do blow.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Several of the spires which have been
mentioned are perceptibly out of the perpendicular,
but in this respect the “tall twisted spire
<a name="p110" id="p110"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of Chesterfield has no rival either in shape or
pose.” It is no less than 230 feet high, and the
wonder to many is that it has for so long maintained
its equilibrium. Various conjectures have
been made to account for the grotesque twist
which the spire assumes; but none of these
seems so likely as that which accounts for it by
the combined action of age, wind, and sun.
There are those who aver that it never was
straight, and never will be, and one such person
even goes so far as to attempt this statement in
rhyme as <span class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width:18em;">
<div class="stanza">
<div>   “Whichever way you turn your eye</div>
<div>    It always seems to be awry,</div>
<div>    Pray can you tell the reason why?</div>
<div>    The only reason known of weight</div>
<div>    Is that the thing was never straight,</div>
<div>    Nor know the people where to go</div>
<div>    To find the man to make it so.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>However this may be, it is satisfactory to note
that a movement has recently been set on foot to
collect subscriptions towards its much needed
repair.</p>

<p>When speaking of Salisbury Cathedral spire,
allusion was made to the repairs being carried
out from a wicker-work contrivance suspended
from the top. This was not the first time that
<a name="p111" id="p111"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>wicker-work had been used for such a purpose,
for in 1787 the spire at S.&nbsp;Mary’s, Islington,
was entirely encased in a cage composed of
willow, hazel, and other sticks, while undergoing
repair. An ingenious basket-maker of S.&nbsp;Albans,
named Birch, carried out the work, and constructed
a spiral staircase inside the cage. His
contract was to do the work for £20 paid down,
and to be allowed to charge sixpence a head to
any sightseers who liked to mount to the top.
It is said that in this way he gained some two or
three pounds a day above his contract.</p>

<p>There is a never-ending romance connected
<a name="p112" id="p112"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>with the subject of spires. Every one possesses
some story or legend. Spirits are supposed to
inhabit their gloomy recesses, and are even
credited with their construction. There is
certainly an uncanny feeling connected with the
interior of a spire, even on a sunny summer’s day,
and given sufficient stress of howling winds and
gloomy darkness, one can almost imagine a
situation conducive to the acutest kind of devilry.
So much for the interior of spires. What sensations
may be produced by climbing the exterior
is given to few to experience. The vast majority
of mankind must perforce content themselves
with a position on <i>terra firma</i>, whence they may

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">On</span> the old tower of the church of Ashton-under-Lyne
there was formerly an old
inscription, which incidently testifies to the
popularity of cards in England at a period when
the notices of that fascinating means of diversion
are both few and of doubtful import. Cards
were given to Europe by the Saracens at the end
of the fourteenth century, and the knowledge of
their use extended itself from France to Greece.
The French clergy were so engrossed by the
pastime that the Synod of Langres, 1404, forbad
it as unclerical. At Bologna, in 1420,
S.&nbsp;Bernardin of Sienna preached with such effect
against the gambling which was indulged in, that
his hearers made on the spot a large bonfire with
packs of cards taken out of their pockets. Under
the word <span title="Chartia">Χαρτια</span> Du&nbsp;Cange quotes extracts from
two Greek writers, which show that cards were
popular in Greece before 1498. Chaucer, who
died in 1400, and who indirectly depicted much
<a name="p114" id="p114"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of the every-day life of his countrymen, does not
once mention cards. But they begin to be
noticed about the time of Edward&nbsp;IV. and
Henry&nbsp;VI. The former king prohibited the importation
of “cards for playing,” in order to
protect the English manufacture of them. An
old ale-wife or brewer, in one of the Chester
plays or mysteries, is introduced in a scene in
Hell, when one of the devils thus addresses
<span class="nw">her:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i2"><span class="kindle">  </span>      Now thou shalte have a feaste.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A more interesting notice of cards occurs in
the <cite>Paston Letters</cite>, where Margery Paston, writing
on “Crestemes Evyn” of the year 1484, tells
her husband that she had sent their eldest son
to Lady Morley (the widow of William Lovel,
Lord Morley), “to hav knolage wat sports wer
husyd [used] in her hows in Kyrstemesse next
folloyng aftyr the decysse of my lord, her
husbond [who died 26th July, 1476]; and sche
sayd that ther wer non dysgysyngs [guisings],
ner harpyng, ner lutyng, ner syngyn, ner non
lowde dysports; but pleyng at the tabyllys, and
<a name="p115" id="p115"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>schesse, and cards: sweche dysports sche gaue
her folkys leve to play and non odyr.” The lady
adds that the youth did his errand right well,
and that she sent the like message by a younger
son to Lady Stapleton, whose lord had died in
1466. “Sche seyd according to my Lady
Morlees seyng in that, and as sche hadde seyn
husyd in places of worschip [<i>i.e.</i>, of distinction:
good families] ther as [=&nbsp;where] sche hath
beyn.” This letter opens up an interesting view
of the amusements which at the time were
introduced into the houses of the nobility and
gentry during Christmas-tide. At that festival
cards from the first formed one of the chief
amusements. Henry&nbsp;VII., who was a great
card player, forbad cards to be used except
during the Christmas holidays. Their ancient
association with Christmas is seen in the kindness
of Sir Roger de Coverley, who was in the
habit of sending round to each of his cottagers
“a string of hogs’-puddings and a pack of cards,”
that good old squire being doubtless of the
opinion of Dr.&nbsp;Johnson, who, with a deeper
human insight than S.&nbsp;Bernardin and Henry&nbsp;VII.,
could see the usefulness of such a pastime: “It
generates kindness and consolidates society.”</p>

<p><a name="p116" id="p116"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>116<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The inscription I have alluded to takes us
back to the reign of an earlier English king than
those named&mdash;Henry&nbsp;V., who reigned 1413&ndash;1422.
In his time, it seems, viz., in 1413, the steeple of
Ashton Church was a-building; when a certain
butcher, Alexander Hyll, playing at noddy with
a companion, doubtless in the neighbourhood of
the church, swore that if the dealer turned up
<em>the five of spades</em> he would build a foot of the
steeple. The very card was turned up! Hyll,
like a good Catholic, performed his promise, and
had his name carved, a butcher’s cleaver being
put before <cite>Alexander</cite>, and the five of spades
before <cite>Hyll</cite>. A new tower was erected in 1516,
when the church was enlarged; but the stone
containing the curious inscription was somewhere
retained, for it was visible in the time of Robert
Dodsworth, the industrious Yorkshire antiquary,
and the projector and co-worker with Dugdale of
the <cite>Monasticon</cite>. Dodsworth, being at Ashton on
the 2nd of April, 1639, copied the inscription,
stating that it was on the church steeple. He
wrote down the tradition, adding that its truth
was attested by Henry Fairfax<!-- TN: original reads "Ffairfax" -->, then rector
there, second son of Thomas Fairfax, Baron de
Cameron (Dodsworth’s MSS. in Bibl. Bodl.,
<a name="p117" id="p117"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>117<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>vol.&nbsp;155, fol.&nbsp;116). The eldest son of Lord
Fairfax was Ferdinando, the celebrated general
of the Commonwealth, and the generous patron
of Dodsworth. Henry, the younger son, at
whose rectory-house Dodsworth was entertained
on the occasion of his Lancashire visit, is
described by Oley (in his preface to George
Herbert’s <cite>Country Parson</cite>) as “a regular and
sober fellow of Trinity College in Cambridge, and
afterwards rector of Bolton Percy in Yorkshire.”
He held, besides, the rectory of Ashton from, at
least, 1623 till 1645, when he was forcibly
ejected; and that of Newton Kyme. He was a
correspondent of Daniel King, author of <cite>The
Vale Royal</cite>, for he had antiquarian tastes like his
brother. He died at Bolton Percy 6th April,
1665. The tower of Ashton Church, as Rector
Fairfax knew it, was taken down and re-built in
1818, by which time all recollection of that
ancient piece of cartomancy in connection with
the steeple had passed out of mind. Let it
be hoped that while the tradition was lively,
pleasanter things were said of Hyll, when the
five of spades was thrown upon the card tables
of Ashton, than assailed the name of Dalrymple
when the nine of diamonds&mdash;the curse of
<a name="p118" id="p118"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>118<span class="ns">]

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">Do</span> not imagine that this is an essay on
campanology, on change-ringing, grandsires,
and triple bob-majors. Do not fancy that
it will deal with carillons, the couvre-feu, or
curfew bell, with the solemn Passing bell, the
bell of the public crier, the jingling sleigh bell,
the distant sheep bell, the noisy railway bell, the
electric call bell, the frantic fire bell, the mellow,

<p>It is of bells and their associations and
inscriptions that we would write, the bells that
are linked with our lives, and record the history
of towns, communities, and nations; announcing
feasts and fasts and funerals, interpreting with
<a name="p120" id="p120"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>metal tongue rejoicings and sorrowings, jubilees
and reverses; pæans for victories by sea and
land; knells for the death of kings and the
leaders of men. As we write, the bells of our
collegiate church are announcing with joyous
clang the arrival of Her Majesty’s Judge of
Assize. Before many days have passed another
bell in the same town will tell with solemn toll
of the short shrift given by him to a pinioned
culprit, the only mourner in his own funeral
procession.</p>

<p>Bells are sentient things. They are alike full
of humour and pathos, of laughter and tears, of
mirth and sadness, of gaiety and grief. One
may pardon Toby Veck, in Charles Dickens’<!-- TN: original reads "Dicken's" -->
goblin story, for investing the bells in the church
near his station with a strange and solemn
character, and peopling the tower with dwarf
phantoms, spirits, elfin creatures of the bells, of
all aspects, shapes, characters, and occupations.
“They were so mysterious, often heard and
never seen, so high up, so far off, so full of such
a deep, strong melody, that he regarded them
with a species of awe; and sometimes, when he
looked up at the dark, arched windows in the
tower, he half expected to be beckoned to by
<a name="p121" id="p121"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>something which was not a bell, and yet was
what he had heard so often sounding in the
chimes.” The bells! The word carries sound
and suggestion with it. It fills the air with
waves of cadence. “Those Evening Bells”
of Thomas Moore’s song swing out undying
echoes from Ashbourne Church steeple; Alfred
Tennyson’s bells “ring out the false, ring in
the true” across the old year’s snow, and his
Christmas bells answer each other from hill to
hill. There are the tragic bells that Sir Henry
Irving hears as the haunted Mathias; “Les
Cloches de Corneville” that agitate the morbid
mind of the miser Gaspard; and the wild bells
that Edgar Allen Poe has set ringing in Runic
rhyme.</p>

<p>“Bell,” says the old German song, “thou
soundest merrily when the bridal party to the
church doth hie; thou soundest solemnly when,
on Sabbath morn, the fields deserted lie; thou
soundest merrily at evening, when bed-time
draweth nigh; thou soundest mournfully, telling
of the bitter parting that hath gone by! Say,
how canst thou mourn or rejoice, that art but
metal dull? And yet all our sorrowings and all
our rejoicings thou art made to express!” In

<p>Churchwardens’ accounts abound with bell
charges. We have before us the accounts of the
churchwardens of Youlgreave, in the Peak of
Derbyshire, for a period of a century and a half.
Under the year 1604 we have “Item to the
ringers on the Coronation Day (James&nbsp;I.), 2s. 6d.;
for mending the Bels agaynst that day, 1s.; and
for fatchinge the great bell yoke at Stanton hall,
<a name="p127" id="p127"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>6d.” In 1605 there is “Item for a rope for a
little bell, 5d.” In the following year is “Item
to the Ringers the 5th day of August, when
thanks was given to God for the delyvering of
King James from the conspiracye of the Lord
Gowyre, 5s.” In 1613 we find the sum of 6d.
expended in purchasing “a stirropp for the fyrst
bell wheele, 8d.” The year 1614 is prolific in
charges connected with the belfry, as the
following enumeration will show: “Item for the
bellefonder, his dinner, and his sonnes, with
other chargs at the same time, 10d.; at the
second coming of the sayd bellfonder, 9d.; at the
taking downe of the bell, 6d.; for castyng the

bought of the bellfounder because the new bell
waeghed more than ye old, £3 15s. 10d.; to the

<a name="p130" id="p130"></a><span class="pageno"><span

 </span></span>Peak district of Derbyshire, notably at Winster,
where the bell is rung throughout November,
December, January, and February at eight
o’clock every work day evening, except on
Saturdays, when the hour is seven. There are
Sanctus bells at Tideswell, Hathersage, Beeley,
Ashover, and other Derbyshire churches. All
Saints’ Church, at Derby (“All Saints,” <i>i.e.</i>,
“the unknown good”), has a melodious set of
chimes. They play the following tunes: Sunday,
“Old One Hundred and Fourth” (Hanover);
Monday, “The Lass of Patie’s Mill”; Tuesday,
“The Highland Lassie”; Wednesday, “The
Shady Bowers”; Thursday, “The National
Anthem”; Friday, Handel’s “March in Scipio”;
Saturday, “The Silken Garter.” They all date
from the last century.</p>

<p>Church bells have the subtle charm of sentiment.
When they swing in the hoary village
tower, and send their mellifluous message across
the country side and down the deep and devious
valley, or when they make musical with mellow
carillon the dreamy atmosphere of moss grown
cathedral closes, they have a poetical influence.
How pleasant it is to listen to the chimes which
ring out from time to time from the towers of
<a name="p131" id="p131"></a><span class="pageno"><span

<p>Church bells in large towns, where one section
of the community are night workers and seek
their rest in the day-time, are by no means
invested with sentiment. We have in our mind
a church which is set in a dense population of
railwaymen, engine drivers, stokers, guards,
porters,&nbsp;&amp;c. It possesses a particularly noisy
peal of bells. They begin their brazen tintinnabulations
at breakfast time, and ring on, at
intervals, until past the supper hour. Sometimes
the sound is a dismal monotone, as if the bellman
had no heart for his work. At other times a
number of stark mad Quasimodos seem to be
pulling at the ropes to frighten the gilded cock
on the vane into flapping flight. Sunday only
brings an increase of the din, distracting all
thought, destroying all conversation, defying all
study, turning the blessed sense of hearing into a
<a name="p132" id="p132"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>curse, and making you envy the deaf. It is well
known that upon many persons in health the
clangour of bells has a very depressing effect;
but at night, when narcotics are given and the
sick are wearied out, it is very easy to imagine
how irritating these bells must be both to the
invalids and their attendants. One is inclined
to exclaim with the <span class="nw">Frenchman&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="author">By J. Potter Briscoe, <span class="postnomial">F.R.H.S.</span></p>

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">On</span> the eve of the feast of Corpus Christi the
choristers of Durham Cathedral ascend
the tower, and, clad in their fluttering robes of
white, sing the <cite>Te Deum</cite>. This custom is
performed to commemorate the miraculous extinguishing
of a conflagration on that night in
the year 1429. The legend goes that, whilst the
monks were engaged in prayer at midnight, the
belfry was struck by the electric current and set
on fire. Though the flames continued to rage
until the middle of the next day, the tower
escaped serious damage, and the bells were
uninjured&mdash;an escape which was imputed to
the special interference of the incorruptible
S.&nbsp;Cuthbert, who was enshrined in that cathedral.
These are not the bells which now reverberate<!-- TN: original reads "reverbrate" -->
among the housetops on the steep banks of the
Wear, they having been cast by Thomas Bartlett
during the summer of 1631.</p>

<p>The fine peal of bells in Limerick Cathedral
were originally brought from Italy, having been
<a name="p134" id="p134"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>manufactured by a young native, who devoted
himself enthusiastically to the work, and who,
after the toil of many years, succeeded in finishing
a splendid peal, which answered all the critical
requirements of his own musical ear. Upon
these bells the artist greatly prided himself, and
they were at length bought by the prior of a
neighbouring convent at a very liberal price.
With the proceeds of that sale the young Italian
purchased a little villa, where, in the stillness of
the evening, he could enjoy the sound of his own
melodious bells from the convent cliff. Here he
grew old in the bosom of his family and of
domestic happiness. At length, in one of those
feuds common to the period, the Italian became
a sufferer amongst many others. He lost his all.
After the passing of the storm, he found himself
preserved alone amid the wreck of fortune,
friends, family, and home. The bells too&mdash;his
favourite bells&mdash;were carried off from the convent,
and finally removed to Ireland. For a time their
artificer became a wanderer over Europe; and at
last, in the hope of soothing his troubled spirit,
he formed the resolution of seeking the land to
which those treasures of his memory had been
conveyed. He sailed for Ireland. Proceeding
<a name="p135" id="p135"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>up the Shannon one beautiful evening, which
reminded him of his native Italy, his own bells
suddenly struck upon his ear! Home, and all
its loving ties, happiness, early recollections, all&mdash;all
were in the sound, and went to his heart. His
face was turned towards the cathedral in the
attitude of intently listening. When the vessel
reached its destination the Italian bellfounder
was found to be a corpse!</p>

<p>Odoceus, Bishop of Llandaff, removed the
bells from his cathedral during a time of
excommunication. Earlier still they are assumed
to have been in use in Ireland as early as the
time of S.&nbsp;Patrick, who died in 493. In those
days much superstitious feeling, as in later ages,
hung around the bells, and many sweetly pretty
and very curious legends are known respecting
them. Thus it is said S.&nbsp;Odoceus, of Llandaff,
being thirsty after undergoing labour, and more
accustomed to drink water than anything else,
came to a fountain in the vale of Llandaff, not
far from the church, that he might drink. Here
he found women washing butter after the manner
of the country. Sending to them his messengers
and disciples they requested that they would
accommodate them with a vessel that their
<a name="p136" id="p136"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>pastor might drink therefrom. These mischievous
girls replied, “We have no other cup
besides that which we hold in our hands,”
namely, the butter. The man of blessed memory
taking it, formed one piece into the shape of a
small bell, and drank from it. The story goes
that it permanently remained in that form, so
that it appeared to those who beheld it to consist
altogether of the purest gold. It is preserved in
the church at Llandaff, and it is said that, by
touching it, health is given to the diseased.</p>

<p>The bell of S.&nbsp;Mura was formerly regarded
with superstitious reverence in Ireland, and any
liquid drunk from it was believed to have peculiar
properties in alleviating human suffering; hence
the peasant women of the district in which it was
long preserved particularly used it in cases of
child-birth, and a serious disturbance was excited
on a former attempt to sell it by its owner. Its
legendary history relates that it descended from
the sky ringing loudly, but as it approached the
concourse of people who had assembled at the
miraculous warning, the tongue detached itself
and returned towards the skies; hence it was
concluded that the bell was never to be profaned
by sounding on earth, but was to be kept for
<a name="p137" id="p137"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>purposes more holy and beneficent. This is
said to have happened on the spot where once
stood the famous Abbey of Fahan, near Innishowen,
in county Donegal, founded in the
seventh century by S.&nbsp;Mura, or Muranus.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hunt, <span class="postnomial">F.R.S.</span>, tells us that, in days
long ago, the inhabitants of the parish of Forrabury&mdash;which
does not cover a square mile, but
which now includes the chief part of the town of
Bocastle and its harbour&mdash;resolved to have a
peal of bells which should rival those of the
neighbouring church of Tintagel, which are said
to have rung merrily at the marriage, and tolled
solemnly at the death of Arthur. The bells were
cast. The bells were blessed. The bells were
shipped for Forrabury. Few voyages were more
favourable. The ship glided, with a fair wind,
along the northern shores of Cornwall, waiting
for the tide to carry her safely into the harbour
of Bottreaux. The vesper bells rang out at
Tintagel. When he heard the blessed bell, the
pilot devoutly crossed himself, and bending his
knee, thanked God for the safe and quick voyage
which they had made. The captain laughed at
the superstition, as he called it, of the pilot, and
swore that they had only to thank themselves for
<a name="p138" id="p138"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the speedy voyage, and that, with his own arm
at the helm, and his judgment to guide them,
they would soon have a happy landing. The
pilot checked this profane speech. The wicked
captain&mdash;and he swore more impiously than ever,
that all was due to himself and his men&mdash;laughed
to scorn the pilot’s prayer. “May God forgive
you,” was the pilot’s reply. Those who are
familiar with the northern shores of Cornwall
will know that sometimes a huge wave, generated
by some mysterious power in the wide Atlantic,
will roll on, overpowering everything by its
weight and force. While yet the captain’s oaths
were heard, and while the inhabitants on the
shore were looking out from the cliffs, expecting
within an hour to see the vessel charged with
their bells safe in their harbour, one of those vast
swellings of the ocean was seen. Onward came
the grand billow in all the terror of its might!
The ship rose not upon the waters as it came
onward! She was overwhelmed, and sank in an
instant close to the land. As the vessel sank,
the bells were heard tolling with a muffled sound,
as if ringing the death knell of the ship and
sailors, of whom the good pilot alone escaped
with life. When storms are coming, and only
<a name="p139" id="p139"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>then, the bells of Forrabury, with their dull
muffled sound, are heard from beneath the
heaving sea, a warning to the wicked. The
tower has remained silent to this day.</p>

<p>Passing through Massingham, in Lincolnshire,
a long time ago, a traveller noticed three men
sitting on a stile in the churchyard, and saying,
“Come to church, Thompson!” “Come to
church, Brown!” and so on. Surprised at this,
the traveller asked what it meant. He was told
that, having no bells, this was how they called
folk to church. The traveller, remarking that it
was a pity so fine a church should have no bells,
asked the men if they could make three for the
church, promising to pay for them himself. This
they undertook to do. They were a tinker, a
carpenter, and a shoemaker respectively. When
the visitor came round that way again, he found
the three men ringing three bells, which said
“Ting, Tong, Pluff,” being made respectively of
tin, wood, and leather.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that John Barton, the
donor of the third bell at Brigstock, Northamptonshire,
was one of several plaintiffs against Sir
John Gouch to recover their rights of common
upon certain lands in the neighbouring parish of
<a name="p140" id="p140"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>140<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Benefield, and that Sir John threatened to ruin
him if he persisted in claiming his right. John
Barton replied that he would leave a cow which,
being pulled by the tail, would low three times a
day, and would be heard all over the common
when he (Sir John) and his heirs would have
nothing to do there. Hence the gift of the bell,
which was formerly rung at four in the morning,
and at eleven at morning and at night. He is
also said to have left means for paying for this
daily ringing.</p>

<p>One Christmas Eve the ringers of Witham-on-the-Hill
left the bells standing for the purpose
of partaking of refreshments at a tavern that
stood opposite the church. One of their number,
a little more thirsty than the rest, insisted that
before going back to ring they should have
another pitcher of ale. This being at length
agreed to by his brother bell-ringers, the party
remained to duly drain the last draught. Whilst
they were drinking, the steeple fell. Whether
this is merely a tapster’s tale, or the sober
statement of a remarkable fact, we are not in a
position to state.</p>

<p>From a curious and rare pamphlet on
“Catholic Miracles,” published in 1825, we
<a name="p141" id="p141"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>141<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>learn that a band of sacrilegious robbers, having
broken into a monastery, proceeded out of
bravado to ring a peal of bells, when, through
prayers offered up by the “holy fathers,” a
miracle was wrought, and the robbers were
unable to leave their hold on the ropes. This
state of affairs was depicted by the inimitable
George Cruikshank in a woodcut, impressions of
which are given in our “Curiosities of the
Belfry,” (Hamilton).</p>

<p>In the village of Tunstall, a few miles distant
from Yarmouth, there is a clump of alder trees,
familiarly known as “Hell Carr.” Not far from
these trees there is a pool of water having a
boggy bottom, that goes by the name of “Hell
Hole.” A succession of bubbles are frequently
seen floating on the surface of the water in
summer time, a circumstance (as Mr. Glyde,
the Norfolk antiquarian author, truly states) that
can be accounted for very naturally; but the
natives of the district maintain that these
bubbles are the result of supernatural action, the
cause of which is thus described. The tower of
the church is in ruins. Tradition says that it
was destroyed by fire, but that the bells were not
injured by the calamity. The parson and the
<a name="p142" id="p142"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>churchwarden each claimed the bells. While
they were quarrelling, his Satanic Majesty
carried out the disputed booty. The clergyman,
however, not desiring to lose the booty, pursued
and overtook the devil, who, in order to evade
his clerical opponent, dived through the earth to
his appointed dwelling-place, taking the bells
with him. Tradition points to “Hell Hole” as
the spot where this hurried departure took place.
The villagers believe that the bubbles on the
surface of the pool are caused by the continuous
descent of the waters to the bottomless pit.</p>

 /><small>THE BELL OF ST. FILLAN.</small>
</div>

<p>In 1778 there was a bell belonging to the
chapel of S.&nbsp;Fillan, which was in high reputation
among the votaries of that saint in olden times.
It was of an oblong shape, about a foot high, and
was usually laid on a gravestone in the churchyard.
Mad people were brought to it to effect a
cure. They were first dipped into the “Saint’s
Pool,” where certain ceremonies were performed,
which partook of the character of Druidism and
Roman Catholicism. The bell was placed in the
chapel, where it remained, bound with ropes, all
night. Next day it was placed upon the heads
of the lunatics with great solemnity, but with
what results “deponent sayeth not.” It was the
<a name="p143" id="p143"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>143<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>popular opinion that, if stolen, this bell would
extricate itself from the hands of the thief and
return home ringing all the way! The bell had
ultimately to be kept under lock and key to
prevent its being used for superstitious purposes.
This old time relic is now in the National
Museum, Edinburgh,
of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland,
and it is described
as follows in the
catalogue: “The
‘Bell of S.&nbsp;Fillan,’
of cast bronze, square
shaped, and with
double-headed, dragonesque
handle. It
lay on a gravestone
in the old churchyard
at Strathfillan,
Perthshire, where it was superstitiously used for
the cure of insanity and other diseases till 1798,
when it was removed by a traveller to England.
It was returned to Scotland in 1869, and
deposited in the Museum by Lord Crawford and
the Bishop of Brechin, with the consent of the
<a name="p144" id="p144"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Heritors and Kirk-Session of S.&nbsp;Fillans.”
Near Raleigh there is a valley which is said to
have been caused by an earthquake several
hundred years ago, which convulsion of nature
swallowed up a whole village, together with the
church. Formerly it was the custom of the
people to assemble in this valley every Christmas
Day morning to listen to the ringing of the bells
of the church beneath them. This, it was
positively asserted, might be heard by placing
the ear to the ground and listening attentively.
As late as 1827 it was usual on this morning for
old men and women to tell their children and
young friends to go to the valley, stoop down,
and hear the bells ring merrily. The villagers
really heard the ringing of the bells of a neighbouring
church, the sound of which was communicated
by the surface of the ground, the
cause being misconstrued through the ignorance
and credulity of the listeners.</p>

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">When</span> those sermons in stone&mdash;the
beautiful fonts of the Decorated and
Perpendicular periods, which preached to a
bygone age&mdash;come to be translated into modern
English on an extensive and systematic scale,
they will be found to be not only sermons
theological, but treatises on hagiology, music,
contemporary history, symbolism, and art of the
highest order. One of the richest fields in font-lore
is to be found in East Anglia, and Norfolk
alone contains examples of sufficient importance
and of vivid interest, to fill a whole volume on
this particular subject. Only to mention a few,
that will rapidly occur to a Norfolk antiquary, is
to conjure up a varied and rich archæological
vision, which can be extended indefinitely at
will.</p>

<p>Of canopied fonts perhaps that of S.&nbsp;Peter
(Mancroft), Norwich, takes the palm. The
carved oak canopy is supported by four massive
posts, giving great dignity to the stone font
<a name="p146" id="p146"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>which it overshadows. The canopy at Sall is of
a more graceful type, being in the form of a
crocketed spire, suspended by a pulley from an
ancient beam projecting from the belfry platform.
Elsing, Merton, and Worstead also possess font
covers of great interest.</p>

<p>Seven Sacrament fonts are numerous, that of
New Walsingham being one of the finest of its
kind in England. It belongs to the Perpendicular
period, and is richly carved. On seven
of its eight panels are sculptured figures representing
the Seven Sacraments, the eighth
exhibiting the Crucifixion. The stem carries
figures of the four Evangelists and other saints,
and rests on an elaborately-carved plinth, the
upper part of which is in the form of a Maltese
cross. A copy of this magnificent structure has
been erected in the Mediæval Court of the
Crystal Palace. A counterpart of the Walsingham
font (more or less exact, though perhaps not
so rich in carving) is to be seen at Loddon, with
similar Maltese cross base, but the Vandal’s
hand has nearly obliterated the figuring of the
Sacramental panels. Other instances of Seven
Sacrament fonts are to be seen in Norwich
Cathedral, at Blofield, Martham, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="p147" id="p147"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>147<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Fonts bearing the date of their erection are
found at Acle and Sall, the former having the
following inscription upon the top step: “Orate
pro diabus qui hūc fontem in honore dei fecerunt
fecit anno dni millo cccc decimo.” An instance
of a Posy font with date (sixteenth century)
occurs in one of the Marshland churches,
the Posy <span class="nw">being:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="display"><span class="smcap">Thynk and Thank.</span></p>

<p>The leaden font at Brundall is believed to be
one of three only of its kind remaining in
England; a fourth, somewhat damaged, existed
at Great Plumstead until a few years ago, when
alas! it perished in a disastrous fire which
practically destroyed the church. Lion fonts
are numerous, those of Acle and Strumpshaw
being excellent examples.</p>

<p>Remarkable examples of carved fonts are
those at Toftrees, Blofield, Wymondham, Bergh
Apton, Aylsham, Ketteringham, Sculthorpe,
Walpole (S.&nbsp;Peter), etc. At Hemblington,
dedicated to All Saints, there is a perfect little
hagiology around the font-pedestal and upon
seven of the panels of the basin, the eighth panel
shewing the mediæval presentment of the Holy
Trinity, the Almighty Father being somewhat
<a name="p148" id="p148"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>148<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>blasphemously represented as an old man, while
the Crucifix rests upon an orb, and (what is
perhaps somewhat unusual) the Holy Dove
appears about to alight on the Cross.</p>

 /><small>FONT AT UPTON CHURCH, NORFOLK.</small>
</div>

<p>Of Decorated Fonts in the county of Norfolk,
that of Upton must be accounted <i>facile princeps</i>.
In beauty of design, in fulness of symbolism, in
richness of detail, it is a faithful type of the
elaborate art of the Decorated Period. It was
originally coloured, fragments of red and blue
<a name="p149" id="p149"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>paint being still visible. A massive base is
formed by three octagonal steps rising tier upon
tier, the upper step divided from the second by
eight sets of quatrefoils, flanked at the corners
by sitting dogs with open mouths. Upon the
stem of the font there are eight figures in <i>bas
relief</i>, standing upon pediments beneath overhanging
canopies exquisitely carved. These
canopies are adorned with crocketed pinnacles,
and the interior of each has a groined roof, with
rose boss in the centre. Some of the pediments
are garnished with foliage, others exhibit quaint
animals, <i>e.g.</i>, a double dragon with but one head
connecting the two bodies, two lions linked by
their tails, and two dogs in the act of biting each
other; all, of course, highly symbolical of various
types of sin. The canopied figures around the
pedestal represent the two Sacraments, an indication
that even in the fourteenth century the
two Sacraments of the Gospel were esteemed as
of the first importance. Holy Communion is
symbolised by five figures. A bishop in eucharistic
vestments, his right hand raised in blessing,
his left holding the pastoral staff, while the
double dragon is beneath his feet. It is not
unlikely that this ecclesiastic was de&nbsp;Spenser, the
<a name="p150" id="p150"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>150<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>contemporary Bishop of Norwich, of military
fame. The bishop is supported to right and
left by angels robed and girded, circlets and
crosses on their heads, each holding a candle in
a somewhat massive candlestick. The graceful
lines of the wings suggest the probability of the
artist having belonged to a continental guild of
stone carvers. The next two figures are priests,
each vested in dalmatic, maniple, stole, and alb,
acting as deacon and sub-deacon, the first holding
an open service book, the second the chalice
and pyx.</p>

<p>The three remaining figures portray<!-- TN: original reads "pourtray" --> Holy
Baptism. Of the two godmothers and the godfather
in the lay dress of the fourteenth century,
the first holds a babe in her arms in swaddling
clothes, the swathing band being crossed again
and again. The other sponsors carry each a
rosary.</p>

<p>To digress for a moment; here is an interesting
deduction. The infant is a girl&mdash;witness
the two godmothers. The font cannot
have been made later than about 1380, at which
time the Decorated merged into the Perpendicular.
Now the lord of the manor of Upton
from 1358 onwards, for many years, was one
<a name="p151" id="p151"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>John Buttetourt, or Botetourt, who, with his wife
Matilda, had an only daughter and heiress, to
whom was given the baptismal name Jocosa. It
appears highly probable that the lord of Upton,
rejoicing at the birth of his little heiress, caused
the font to be designed and built as a memorial
of her baptism. But it would seem that he did
not live to see her settled in life, for in 1399
she had grown to early womanhood, had won
the affection of Sir Hugh Burnell, who made
her his wife, and by the following year, if
not before, she had inherited the manor in her
own right.</p>

<p>To return to the description of the font.
Resting on the canopies above described, and
supported by eight half-angels with musical
instruments, etc., is the large and handsome
laver. The principal panels are occupied by
reliefs of the four living creatures of the Revelation&mdash;the
historic emblems of the four Evangelists&mdash;the
flying lion, the flying bull, the man, and
the eagle, the last named with scroll facing east.
The four alternative panels represent angels,
two holding instruments of music, two with
heraldic shields. The panels are separated from
each other by crocketed buttresses. The musical
<a name="p152" id="p152"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>152<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>instruments shewn upon the font are of great
interest. A kind of rebeck or lute twice occurs,
and once a curious pair of cymbals. One half-angel
is playing on a crowth, an early form of
the fiddle, consisting of an oblong box, a couple
of strings, a short straight and round handle,
and a bow. Another of the half-angels holds
an open music book, containing the ancient
four-line score.</p>

<p>The font has suffered some amount of mutilation
in the five centuries of its existence; three
or four heads have disappeared, also the right
hand of the bishop, and the top of the pastoral
staff; the chalice has been broken off, and the
flying lion is fractured. And as a reminder of
the iconoclastic century which was most likely
responsible for the damage, these dates are
roughly cut into the leaden lining of the bowl:
1641, 1662, 1696.</p>

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">The</span> smallest acquaintance with the inventories,
or the ceremonial, of our mediæval
churches is sufficient to show anyone a glimpse
of the extraordinary wealth of which the larger
churches especially were possessed in those days.
Vestments of velvet and silk and cloth of gold,
adorned with jewels and the precious metals;
crosses and candlesticks of gold, studded with
gems; reliquaries that were ablaze with gorgeousness
and beauty; and sometimes shrines and
altars that were a complete mass of invaluable
treasure; such were the contents of the choirs
and sacristies of our cathedrals and abbey
churches. This being the case, it is obvious
that the greatest care had to be taken of such
places. Then, even as now, there were desperadoes
from whom the sanctity of the shrine could
not protect it, if they could get a chance of
fingering its jewels; men who would exclaim,
with Falconbridge in the play of “King John”
(Act&nbsp;III., <span class="nw">Sc.&nbsp;3)&mdash;</span></p>

 /></span></span> “Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,</div>
<div>  When gold and silver beck me to come on.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To protect the wealthier churches from desecration
and loss, therefore, bands of watchers
were organized, who throughout the night should
be ever on the alert against the attacks of
thieves; who would also, moreover, be able to
raise, if need were, the alarm of fire. At Lincoln
these guardians patrolled the Minster at nightfall,
to assure themselves that all was safe. To
facilitate the inspection of the whole building
occasionally squints were made; as at the
Cathedral of S.&nbsp;David’s, where the cross pierced
in the east wall behind, and just above, the high
altar, is supposed by some to have been for this
purpose, a view being thus obtained of the choir
from the Chapel of the Holy Trinity, or <i>vice
versâ</i>.</p>

 <img src="images/p155.jpg" alt="" id="img155" /><br
 /><small>ABBOT’S PEW, MALMESBURY ABBEY.</small>
</div>

<p>In several instances, however, it was found
both more convenient and more effective to
erect a special chamber, so placed and so
elevated as to command a good view of the
church, or of the portion of the church to be
watched; and here a constant succession of
watchers kept guard. One of our most interesting
examples of this is at S.&nbsp;Albans. Near the
<a name="p157" id="p157"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>157<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>site of the shrine of the patron saint (on which
the fragments of the shattered shrine have been
skilfully built up once more) is a structure, in
two storeys, of carved timber. The lower stage
is fitted with cupboards, in which were probably
preserved relics, or such jewels and ornaments
as were not kept permanently upon the shrine.
A doorway in this storey admits to a staircase
leading to the gallery above. This is the
watchers’ chamber; the side fronting the shrine
being filled with perpendicular tracery, whence
the monks in charge could easily keep the
treasures around them under observation. A
somewhat similar structure is still seen at Christ
Church, Oxford, and is sometimes spoken of as
the shrine of S.&nbsp;Frideswide. It is really the
watching-chamber for that shrine; and was
erected in the fourteenth century upon an
ancient tomb, supposed to be that of the
founder of the <i>feretrum</i> of the saint, though
popular report describes it as the resting-place
of the bodies of her parents.</p>

<p>In not a few cases, both in England and
abroad, these chambers were built in a yet more
durable fashion. At Bourges may be seen a
stone loft on the left side of the altar; at
<a name="p158" id="p158"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>158<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Nuremberg also is one. In addition to the
wooden chamber, already described, S.&nbsp;Alban’s
Abbey (now the cathedral) has a small one of
stone in the transept. Lichfield has a gallery
over the sacristy door, which served the same
purpose; and at Worcester an oriel was
probably used by the watchers. Westminster
Abbey has such a chamber over the chantry of
King Henry&nbsp;VI., and Worcester Cathedral has
one in the north aisle; and there are several
other instances. Many churches had rooms
over the north porch, as the cathedrals of
Exeter and Hereford, the churches of Christchurch
(Hampshire), Alford (Lincolnshire), and
many others; and these in some cases, as at
Boston, had openings commanding a view of the
interior.</p>

<p>Another explanation of the existence of a few
watching lofts is sometimes given, besides the
need of guarding the Church’s treasures. It is
held by some that in the face of the deterioration
of monastic simplicity and devotion in the later
times before the Dissolution in England, the
abbots felt the need of keeping a stricter eye
upon their community; and these rooms were
consequently constructed to enable them to
<a name="p159" id="p159"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>159<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>look, unobserved themselves, into their abbey
church, and to see that all whose duty called for
their presence were there, and properly occupied.
This theory is perhaps supported by the traditional
name of “the abbot’s pew,” by which a
very simple and substantial watching-chamber
in the triforium of Malmesbury Abbey is called.
With this may be compared another example in
the priory church of S.&nbsp;Bartholomew, Smithfield.
In these, and most of the other instances,
the watching-chamber is an addition to the
original structure, dating often considerably
later than the rest. This is quoted by the
believers in the rapid spread of monastic depravity
in later ages in support of the theory
just noticed; as is also the fact, that the “pew”
is often near what formerly constituted the
abbot’s private apartments within the adjoining
monastery. It is probable that both explanations
are true; some of these lofts forming
“abbot’s pews,” as others certainly were for the
guardian watchers of the shrines. In a large
community it would certainly be wise for the
head to be able at times to survey quietly and
unobserved the actions of the rest; but this
admission no more implies that the lives of all
<a name="p160" id="p160"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>monks were scandalous, than does the presence
of watchers by the shrines prove that all worshippers
were thieves.</p>

<p>We have noticed in this paper the chief
watching-chambers in this country, but no doubt
other examples occur which may have special
points of interest.</p>

<p class="author">By the Rev. Geo. S. Tyack, <span class="postnomial">B.A.</span></p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">An</span> interesting article of Church furniture
which has scarcely received the amount
of notice which it deserves, is the Church Chest,
the receptacle for the registers and records of the
parish, and sometimes also for the office books,
vestments, and other valuables belonging to the
Church. In recent years attention has frequently
been directed to the interesting character of our
ancient parochial documents, but the useful
cases which for so many years have shielded
them, more or less securely, from damage or
loss, have been largely overlooked.</p>

<p>The present authority for the provision in
every English church of a proper repository for
its records is the seventieth canon, the latter
part of which runs in the following words, from
which it will be seen that some of its details
have been suffered to become obsolete: “For
the safe keeping of the said book (the register of
baptisms, weddings, and burials), the churchwardens,
at the charge of the parish, shall
<a name="p162" id="p162"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>162<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>provide one sure coffer, and three locks and
keys; whereof one to remain with the minister,
and the other two with the churchwardens severally;
so that neither the minister without the
two churchwardens, nor the churchwardens
without the minister, shall at any time take that
book out of the said coffer. And henceforth
upon every Sabbath day immediately after
morning or evening prayer, the minister and
the churchwardens shall take the said parchment
book out of the said coffer, and the minister in
the presence of the churchwardens shall write
and record in the said book the names of all
persons christened, together with the names and
surnames of their parents, and also the names of
all persons married and buried in that parish in
the week before, and the day and year of every
such christening, marriage, and burial; and that
done, they shall lay up the book in the coffer as
before.” This Canon, made with others in 1603,
was a natural sequence to the Act passed in
1538, which enjoined the due keeping of parish
registers of the kind above described. It is, in
fact, obvious that the canon only gave additional
sanction to a practice enforced some years
earlier; for Grindal, in his “Metropolitical
<a name="p163" id="p163"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Visitation of the Province of York in 1571,” uses
almost identical terms, requiring, amongst many
other things, “That the churchwardens in every
parish shall, at the costs and charges of the
parish, provide ... a sure coffer with two locks
and keys for keeping the register book, and a
strong chest or box for the almose of the poor,
with three locks and keys to the same:” the
same demand was made, also by Grindal, on the
province of Canterbury in 1576.</p>

<p>Church chests did not, however, come into
use in consequence of the introduction of the
regular keeping of registers. The Synod of
Exeter, held in 1287, ordered that every parish
should provide “a chest for the books and the
vestments,” and the convenience and even
necessity of some such article of furniture,
doubtless led to its use in many places from yet
earlier times.</p>

<p>We have in England several excellent examples
of “hutches,” or chests, which date from the
thirteenth, or even from the close of the twelfth
century. Some there are for which a much
earlier date has been claimed. These latter are
rough coffers formed usually of a single log of
wood, hollowed out, and fitted with a massive
<a name="p164" id="p164"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>164<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>lid, the whole being bound with iron bands.<!-- TN: original has comma -->
Chests of this kind may be seen at Newdigate,<!-- TN: original has period -->
Surrey, at Hales Owen, Shropshire, and elsewhere;
and on the strength of the rudeness of
the carpentry displayed, it has been asserted
that they are of Norman, or even of Saxon,
workmanship. Roughness of design and work
are scarcely, however, in themselves sufficient
evidence of great antiquity; many local causes,
especially in small country places, may have led
the priests and people to be content with a very
rude article of home manufacture, at a time when
far more elaborate ones were procurable in return
for a little more enterprise or considerably more
money. The date of these rough coffers must
therefore be considered doubtful.</p>

<p>Of Early English chests, we have examples at

<p>In the making of all these coffers, strength was
naturally the great characteristic which was
most obviously aimed at; strength of structure,
so as to secure durability, and strength of locks
and bolts, so as to ensure the contents from
theft. But in addition to this, artistic beauty
was not lost sight of, and many chests are
excellent illustrations of the wood-carvers’ taste
and skill, and several were originally enriched
with colour.</p>

 /></span></span>A good example of those in which security has
been almost exclusively sought, is provided by a
chest at S.&nbsp;Peter’s, Upton, Northamptonshire.
The dimensions of this hutch are six feet three
inches in length, two feet six inches in height,
and two feet in width. Its only adornment is
provided by the wrought iron bands which are
attached to it. Four of these are laid laterally
across each end, and four more, running perpendicularly,
divide the front into five unequal
panels; the bands on the front correspond with
an equal number laid across the lid, where,
however, two more are placed at the extreme
ends. Each of the panels in front and top is
filled with a device in beaten iron roughly
resembling an eight-pointed star, the lowest
point of which runs to the bottom of the chest.
Yet simpler is the chest at S.&nbsp;Mary’s, West
Horsley, which is a long, narrow, oaken box,
strengthened by flat iron bands crossing the ends
and doubled well round the front and back,
while six others are fastened perpendicularly to
the front; there are two large locks, and three
hinges terminating in long strips of iron running
almost the complete breadth of the lid. The
church of S.&nbsp;Botolph, Church Brampton, has
<a name="p169" id="p169"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>169<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>a chest equally plain in itself, but the iron bands
are in this case of a richer character. Elegant
scroll-work originally covered the front and ends,
much still remaining to this day. S.&nbsp;Lawrence’s,
in the Isle of Thanet, possesses an exceedingly
rough example, with a curved top; seven broad
iron bands strengthen the lid, and several perpendicular
ones, crossed by a lateral one, are
affixed to the front, the whole being studded with
large square-headed nails; a huge lock is placed
in the middle, with hasps for padlocks to the
right and left of it. It is raised slightly from the
ground by wooden “feet.”</p>

must be awarded to a coffer at Stonham Aspel.
The following description of this remarkable
chest was given in the “Journal of the British
Archæological Society” in September, 1872:
“This curious example is of chestnut wood,
8&nbsp;feet in length, 2&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches in height, and
2&nbsp;feet 7&nbsp;inches from front to back; and is entirely
covered on the outer surface with sheets of iron
4½ inches in width, the joinings being hid by
straps. The two lids are secured by fourteen
hasps; the second from the left locks the first,
and the hasp simply covers the keyhole; the
fourth locks the third, etc. After this process is
finished, a bar from each angle passes over them,
and is secured by a curious lock in the centre,
which fastens them both. The interior of this
gigantic chest is divided into two equal compartments
by a central partition of wood, the one to
the left being painted red; the other is plain.
Each division can be opened separately; the rector
holding four of the keys, and the churchwardens
the others, all being of different patterns.” The
writer of this description (Mr. H.&nbsp;Syer Cuming,
<span class="postnomial">F.S.A.</span>, Scot., <span class="postnomial">V.P.</span>) assigns the chest to the fifteenth
century.</p>

 /></span></span>Turning now to those chests, whose makers,
while not forgetting the needful solidity and
strength, aimed also at greater decoration, the
handsome hutch at S.&nbsp;Michael’s, Coventry,
claims our notice. The front of this is carved
with a double row of panels having traceried
heads, the upper row being half the width of the
lower one. In the centre are two crowned
figures, popularly (and not improbably) described
as Leofric and his wife, the Lady Godiva. At
each end of the front is a long panel decorated
with lozenges enclosing Tudor roses, foliage, and
conventional animals; while two dragons adorn
the bottom, which is cut away so as to leave a
triangular space beneath the chest. At S.&nbsp;John’s,
Glastonbury, is another fine example,
measuring six feet two inches in length, and at
present lidless. Within six vesica-shaped panels
are placed quatrefoil ornaments, each divided by
a horizontal bar. Above these are five shields,
three charged with S.&nbsp;George’s Cross, and the
others, one with three lozenges in fess, and the
other with three roundles, two and one, and a
label. The ends, or legs, are elaborately carved
with dog-tooth figures in squares and circles.
Saltwood, Kent, has an ornately carved chest,
<a name="p174" id="p174"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>174<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>divided (like that of Stonham Aspel) into two
parts, the lid being correspondingly formed, and
opening in sections. One half is secured by
three locks, and the other by one. The front is
carved with five geometrical “windows” of four
lights each; and the ends of the front have three
carved square panels, divided by bands of
dancette ornament. The base has a long
narrow panel, with a simple wavy design. There
is some bold carving on a chest at S.&nbsp;George’s,
South Acre, in Norfolk; a row of cusped arches
fills rather more than half the height of the front,
the rest being taken up with four panels containing
roses and stars, similar designs on a smaller
scale being repeated at the ends. The front is
cut away at the bottom in a series of curves.</p>

<p>At Alnwick is a massive coffer, over seven feet
long, bearing on its front a number of figures of
dragons, and heads of birds and beasts, amid
foliage; above which are two hunting scenes, in
which appear men with horns, dogs, and deer,
amid trees. These two scenes are separated by
the lock, and are precisely alike, save that the
quarry in one is a stag, and a hind in the other.
Empingham, near Stamford, has a fine chest of
cedar wood, adorned with incised figures. At
<a name="p177" id="p177"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>177<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>S.&nbsp;Mary’s, Mortlake, is one of walnut, inlaid
with boxwood and ebony, and ornamented with
designs in metal work; the under side of the lid
has some delicate iron-wrought tracery, which
was originally set off with red velvet. The
Huttoft chest is enriched with traceried arches,
which were apparently at one time picked out in
colour; that of Stoke D’Abernon is raised on
four substantial legs, and is decorated with three
circles on the front filled with a kind of tracery;
there are other interesting specimens at Winchester
and at Ewerby. In the old castle at
Newcastle-on-Tyne is preserved an old church
coffer, which was probably removed there for
safety during the troublous days of the Civil
War. At Harty Chapel, Kent, we find the
figures of two knights in full armour, tilting at
each other, carved on the front of a chest; the
legend of S.&nbsp;George and the dragon is illustrated
in a similar way at Southwold Church,
Suffolk, and yet more fully on a chest in the
treasury of York Minster.</p>

<p>Probably, however, the handsomest example
of a carved church chest now preserved in
England is at Brancepeth, in the county of
Durham. This beautiful piece of work, which
<a name="p178" id="p178"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>178<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>rests in the south chapel of the church, has its
front completely covered with elaborate carving.
At either end are three oblong panels, one above
another, on each of which is a conventional bird
or beast; at the base is a series of diamonds
filled, as are the intervals between them, with
tracery; and above this is an arcade of six
pointed arches, each enclosing three lights surmounted
by a circle, the six being divided by
tall lancets, the crockets of the arches and a
wealth of foliage filling up the intervening
spaces. This fine chest dates from the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>The Rev. Francis E. Powell, <span class="postnomial">M.A.</span>, in his
pleasantly-written work entitled “The Story of
a Cheshire Parish,” gives particulars of the
parish chest of Over. “The chest,” says Mr.
Powell, was “the gift of Bishop Samuel Peploe
to Joseph Maddock, Clerk, April 30th, 1750.”
It probably was an old chest even then. The
donor was Bishop of Chester from 1726 to
1752. He was a Whig in politics, and a
latitudinarian in religion, as so many bishops of
that time were. That he was a man of determined
courage may be seen by his loyalty to the
House of Hanover, even under adverse
<a name="p179" id="p179"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>179<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>circumstances. One day, in the year 1715, he was
reading Morning Prayer at the parish church at
Preston. The town was occupied by Jacobite
troops, some of whom burst into the church
during the service. Approaching the prayer-desk,
with drawn sword, a trooper demanded
that Peploe should substitute James for George
in the prayer for the King’s Majesty. Peploe
merely paused to say, “Soldier, I am doing my
duty; do you do yours;” and went on with the
prayers, whereupon the soldiers at once proceeded
to eject him from the church. The
illustration of the chest is kindly lent to us by
the Rev. Francis E. Powell, vicar of Over.</p>

<p>In the vestry of Lambeth Palace is a curiously
painted chest; several of an early date are preserved
in the triforium of Westminster Abbey;
there is one at Salisbury Cathedral, and another
in the Record Office, having been removed from
the Pix Chapel.</p>

<p>One of the original uses of these coffers, as we
have seen, was to preserve the vestments of the
church. The copes, however, being larger than
the other vestments, and in the cathedrals and
other important churches, being very numerous,
frequently had a special receptacle provided.
<a name="p180" id="p180"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>180<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>At York, Salisbury, Westminster, and Gloucester,
ancient cope-chests are still preserved. These
are triangular in shape, the cope being most
easily folded into that form.</p>

<p>In not a few instances these large coffers, or
sections of them, were used as alms boxes, for
which a very ancient precedent can be found.
At the restoration of the Jewish Temple under
King Joash, we are told (2&nbsp;Kings xii., 9, 10)
that “Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and
bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside
the altar, on the right side as one cometh into
the house of the Lord: and the priests that kept
the door put therein all the money that was
brought into the house of the Lord: and it was
so, when they saw that there was much money
in the chest, that the King’s scribe and the high
priest came up, and they put up in bags, and
told the money that was found in the house of
the Lord.”</p>

<p>At Llanaber, near Barmouth in North Wales,
is a chest hewn from a single block of wood, and
pierced to receive coins. At Hatfield, Yorkshire,
is an ancient example of a similar kind; and
others may be seen at S.&nbsp;Peter’s-in-the-East,
Oxford, at Drayton in Berkshire, at Meare
<a name="p181" id="p181"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>181<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Church, Somersetshire, at Irchester and Mears
Ashby, in Northamptonshire, at Hartland, in
Devonshire, and in the Isle of Wight at Carisbrooke.
An interesting chest, with provision for
the reception of alms, is preserved at Combs
Church, Suffolk, where there is also another
plain hutch, iron-bound and treble-locked. The
chest in question is strongly, but simply, made,
the front being divided into four plain panels,
with some very slight attempt at decoration in
the form of small disks and diamonds along the
top; and the lid being quite flat and plain, and
secured by two locks. At one end, however, a
long slit has been cut in this lid, and beneath it
is a till, or trough, to receive the money, very
similar to the little locker often inserted at one
end of an old oak chest intended for domestic
use, save that in this case the compartment has,
of course, no second lid of its own. This chest
has the date 1599 carved upon it, but is supposed
to be some half a century older, the date perhaps
marking the time of some repairs or alterations
made in it.</p>

<p>Hutches of the kind that we have been considering
are not peculiar to England, some fine
and well-preserved examples being found in
<a name="p182" id="p182"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>182<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>several of the ancient churches in France.
Among ourselves it is obvious that great numbers
must have disappeared; many doubtless were
rough and scarcely worthy of long preservation;
others by the very beauty of their workmanship
probably roused the cupidity, or the iconoclastic
prejudice, of the spoiler. Near Brinkburn Priory
a handsome fourteenth century chest was found,
used for domestic purposes, in a neighbouring
farm-house; a Tudor chest, belonging to
S.&nbsp;Mary’s, Newington, lay for years in the old
rectory house, and subsequently disappeared;
and these are doubtless typical of many another
case. When the strictness at first enforced as
to the care of the parish registers became
culpably relaxed, and parish clerks and sextons
were left in practically sole charge of them, it is
but too probable that these men, often illiterate
and otherwise unsuited to such a trust, were in
many instances as careless, or as criminal, in
regard to the coffers, as we unfortunately know
they frequently were with respect to their contents.</p>

<p>Few church chests of any interest date from
the Jacobean, or any subsequent period. Plain
deal boxes were then held good enough for the
purpose of a “church hutch.”</p>

 /></span></span>An Antiquarian Problem: The Leper Window.</h2>

<p class="author">By William White, <span class="postnomial">F.S.A.</span></p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">These</span> windows were called by Parker and
other writers of the Gothic Revival,
“Lychnoscopes;” and then by the ecclesiologists,
“Low-side Windows.” But the name
given by the late G.&nbsp;E. Street has now become
so generally accepted that it seems necessary
to look a little further into the evidence of the
fitness or unfitness of this designation for them.</p>

<p>Behind some stalls in the Royal Chapel were
discovered some remains of a mural painting,
apparently to represent the communicating of a
leper through some such window, and he at once
concluded that it was for this very purpose so
many of them were introduced into the chancels
of our mediæval churches. There seemed, however,
nothing to indicate that it was at one of
these special windows at all that this function
was performed. And the very fact of the representation
itself would seem to indicate rather an
exceptional instance, or special circumstance,
such as the communicating of some knight or
<a name="p184" id="p184"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>184<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>person of note who might, for instance, have
brought leprosy in his own person from the Holy
Land, from whence probably in the first instance
it came; and who would not be admitted within
the church. But the records of the existence of
lepers would seem to show their numbers to have
been very limited, and confined to few localities.
And in any case this would be no sufficient cause
for the introduction of these windows as of universal
occurrence throughout the land, for these
windows are found almost everywhere, and in
very many instances on both sides of the chancel.
Moreover, in many cases the act of administration
through these windows would be exceedingly
difficult, if not impossible, on account of the
position, or the arrangement, of the window itself.</p>

<p>To my mind a very much more practical and
reasonable supposition would be that they were
introduced, and used, for burial purposes. At
a period when the body would not be brought
into the church, except in the case of some
ecclesiastic or other notable person, the priest
would here be able, <em>from his stall</em>, to see the
funeral <i>cortége</i> come into the churchyard, and
then say the first part of the office through this
window; which was always shuttered and without
<a name="p185" id="p185"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>185<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>glass. In some cases there is a book-ledge
corbelled out on the east jamb of the window
inside, which has puzzled antiquaries, but which
has not otherwise received a satisfactory explanation.
In immediate proximity to the window,
at the end of the stalls (and sometimes in the
earlier churches <em>through</em> them), was the priest’s
door, out of which he would then proceed to the
grave to commit the body to the earth. The
grave itself needs not necessarily be within sight
of the window. But in a number of instances
the churchyard cross was so; and this may have
served as the recognised place for the mourners,
with the body, to assemble.</p>

<p>In the case of Foxton, Leicestershire, the
“Lych Window,” as I would call it, is on the
north side. Here the burials are chiefly on
the north side; a steep slope down towards the
church on the south side rendering it very
difficult and unsuitable for them. At Addisham,
Kent, the priest’s door is, contrary to the usual
custom, on the north side, where is also a
principal portion of the churchyard, and, so far
as my own observations go, the position of the
window would greatly depend upon the arrangement
of the churchyard, whether north or south.</p>

<p class="author">By the Rev. Geo. S. Tyack, <span class="postnomial">B.A.</span></p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">Something</span> concerning the construction
of labyrinths, or mazes, is known even to
the most general reader; it needs but a slight
acquaintance with classical literature to learn of
the famous example formed at Crete by Dædalus;
the legend of the concealment of “fair Rosamond,”
within a maze at Woodstock, is familiar
enough; and the existing labyrinth at Hampton
Court, the work of William&nbsp;III. is well known.
But probably few who have not looked somewhat
into the matter, have any idea of the number
of such mazes which still exist, or of the yet
greater number of which we have authentic
records. A learned French antiquary, Mons.
Bonnin, of Evreux, collected two hundred
examples, gathered from many lands, and
stretching in history from classical to modern
times.</p>

<p>Of the most ancient labyrinths it will be
enough to indicate the localities. One is said to
have been constructed in Egypt by King Minos,
<a name="p187" id="p187"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>187<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and to have served as a model for the one raised
by Dædalus at Cnossus, in Crete, as a prison
for the Minataur<!-- TN: sic -->. Another Egyptian example,
which has been noticed by several authors, was
near Lake Mœris. Lemnos contained a famous
labyrinth; and Lar Porsena built one at Clusium,
in Etruria. These mazes consisted either of a
series of connected caverns, as it has been
supposed was the case in Crete; or, as in the
<a name="p188" id="p188"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>188<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>other instances, were formed of courts enclosed
by walls and colonnades.</p>

 <img src="images/p187.jpg" alt="" id="img187" /><br
 /><small>LABYRINTH INSCRIBED ON ONE OF THE PORCH PIERS OF LUCCA CATHEDRAL.</small>
</div>

<p>The use of the labyrinth in mediæval times,
has, however, greater interest for us in this
paper, especially from the fact that such was
distinctly ecclesiastical. Several continental
churches have labyrinths, either cut in stone or
inlaid in coloured marbles, figured upon their
walls or elsewhere. At Lucca Cathedral is an
example incised upon one of the piers of the
porch; and others may be seen at Pavia, Aix in
Provence, and at Poitiers. These are all small,
the diameter of the Lucca labyrinth being
1&nbsp;foot 7½ inches, which is the dimension also
of one in an ancient pavement in the church
of S.&nbsp;Maria in Aquiro, in Rome. That the
suggestion for the construction of these arose
from the mythological legends concerning those
of pagan days is proved by the fact that in
several of them the figures of Theseus and the
Minataur<!-- TN: sic --> were placed in the centre. Probably
from the first, the Church, in her use of the
figure, spiritualized the meaning of the heathen
story, as we know was her wont in other cases;
and a labyrinth formed in mosaic on the floor of
an ancient basilica at Orleansville, Algeria, shows
<a name="p189" id="p189"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>189<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>that presently the mythological symbols gave
place entirely to obviously Christian ones. In
this last-named instance, the centre is occupied
by the words <cite>Sancta Ecclesia</cite>.</p>

<p>About the twelfth century these curious figures
became very popular, and a considerable number
dating from that period still exist. They have
for the most part been constructed in parti-coloured
marbles on some portion of the floor of
the church. One was laid down in 1189 at
S.&nbsp;Maria in Trastevere, in Rome; S.&nbsp;Vitale,
Ravenna, contains another; and the parish
church of S.&nbsp;Quentin has a third. Others
formerly existed at Amiens Cathedral (made in
1288 and destroyed in 1825), at Rheims (made
about 1240 and destroyed in 1779), and at Arras
(destroyed at the Revolution). These are much
larger than the examples before noticed; the two
Italian examples are each about 11 feet across,
but the French ones greatly exceed this. Those
of S.&nbsp;Quentin and Arras were each over 34 feet
in diameter, and the others were somewhat
larger; Amiens possessed the largest, measuring
42 feet. France had another example of a
similar kind at Chartres.</p>

<p>The Christian meaning which was read into
<a name="p190" id="p190"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>190<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>these complicated designs was more emphatically
expressed in these twelfth-century instances.
The centre is usually occupied by a cross, round
which, in some cases, were arranged figures of
bishops, angels, and others.</p>

<p>The introduction of these large labyrinths,
together with the name which came at this time
to be applied to them in France, namely,
<i>Chemins de Jerusalem</i>, suggests the new use to
which such arrangements now began to be put.
It is well known that in some cases substitutes
for the great pilgrimage to Jerusalem were
allowed to be counted as of almost equal merit.
Thus the Spaniards, so long as they had not
expelled the infidel from their own territory,
were forbidden to join the Crusades to the Holy
Land; and were permitted to substitute a journey
to the shrine of S.&nbsp;Jago, at Compostella, for one
to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. By an
extension of the same principle, especially when
the zeal of Christendom for pilgrimages began to
cool, easy substitutes for the more exacting
devotion were found in many ways. The introduction
of the Stations of the Cross is ascribed
to this cause, the devout following in imagination
of the footsteps of the Saviour in His last sufferings,
<a name="p191" id="p191"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>191<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>being accounted equivalent to visiting the
holy places; and somewhat similarly, the maze,
or labyrinth, is said to have been pressed into the
service of religion, the following out (probably
upon the knees) of its long and tortuous path-
way, being reckoned as a simple substitute for a
longer pilgrimage.</p>

<p>From such a use as this, it was no great step
to the employment of the maze as a means of
penance in other cases. The whole of the
intricate pathway was intended to remind the
penitent of the difficulties which beset the
Christian course; and the centre, which could
only be reached by surmounting them, was often
called heaven (<i>Ciel</i>). Nor could such a penance
be deemed a light one. Though occupying so
small a space of ground, the mazy path was so
involved as to reach a considerable length,
whence it was sometimes named the League
(<i>La lièue</i>). The pathway at Chartres measures
668 feet; at Sens was a maze which required
some 2,000 steps to gain the centre. An hour is
said to have been often needed to accomplish
the journey, due allowance being made for the
prayers which had to be recited at certain fixed
stations of it, or throughout its whole course.</p>

<p><a name="p192" id="p192"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>192<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>At S.&nbsp;Omer are one or two examples of the
labyrinth. One at the Church of Notre Dame
has figures of towns, mountains, rivers, and wild
beasts depicted along the pathway, to give, no
doubt, greater realism to the pilgrimage. The
existing drawing of another, which has been
destroyed, is inscribed, “The way of the road to
Jerusalem at one time marked on the floor of the
Church of S.&nbsp;Bertin.” Many of these designs
are not only ingenious, but beautiful. In the
Chapterhouse at Bayeux is one enriched with
heraldic figures; that at Chartres has its central
circle relieved with six cusps, while an engrailed
border encloses the whole work. A circular
shape was apparently the most popular; the
maze at S.&nbsp;Quentin, with some others, however,
is octagonal. The pathway is usually marked
by coloured marbles, sometimes the darker,
sometimes the lighter shades in the design being
used for the purpose; at Sens, lead has been
employed to indicate it.</p>

<p>The Revolution, as we have seen, led to the
destruction of several ecclesiastical labyrinths;
some, however, became a source of annoyance
to the worshippers, from children attempting
to trace the true pathway during the time of
<a name="p193" id="p193"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>193<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>service, and they were removed in consequence.
Labyrinths of this kind do not appear to have
been introduced into England, the only instance
known to the present writer being quite a modern
one. This is in the church porch at Alkborough,
in Lincolnshire, where, at the recent restoration,
the design of a local maze (to be noticed further
hereafter) was reproduced.</p>

<p>If England, however, has not imitated the
continent in this respect, she has struck out a
line no less interesting, which has remained
almost exclusively her own; namely, in the
mazes cut in the green turf of her meadows.
Shakespeare has an allusion to these in the
“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” (Act iii., 3)
where Titania says,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:22em;">
<div class="stanza">
<div> “The nine men’s morris is fill’d up with mud,</div>
<div>  And the quaint mazes in the wanton green</div>
<div>  For lack of tread are indistinguishable.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some twenty of these rustic labyrinths have
been noted as still existing, or as recorded by
a sound tradition, in England; and no doubt
there have been others which have disappeared,
leaving no trace behind.</p>

 /><small>MAZE AT ALKBOROUGH, LINCOLNSHIRE.</small>
</div>

<p>Among those which have been preserved, the
following may be noticed. At Alkborough, in
<a name="p194" id="p194"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>194<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Lincolnshire, near the confluence of the Trent
and the Ouse, is a maze, the diameter of which
is 44 feet; by a happy suggestion, the design of
this has been repeated, as was above remarked,
in the porch of the Parish Church, so that
should the original unfortunately be destroyed,
a permanent record has been provided. Hilton,
in Huntingdonshire has a maze of exactly the
<a name="p195" id="p195"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>195<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>same plan, in the centre of which is a stone
pillar, bearing an inscription in Latin and
English, to the effect that the work was constructed
in 1660, by William Sparrow. Comberton,
in Cambridgeshire, possesses a maze,
locally known as the “Mazles,” which is fifty
feet in diameter. The pathway is two feet
wide, and is defined by small trenches, the
whole surface being gradually hollowed towards
<a name="p196" id="p196"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>196<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the centre. Northamptonshire is represented by
Boughton Green, which has a labyrinth 37 feet
in diameter; and Rutland has one at Wing,
which measures 40 feet.</p>

 /><small>THE MIZE-MAZE ON ST. KATHERINE’S HILL, WINCHESTER.</small>
</div>

<p>At Asenby, in the parish of Topcliffe, Yorkshire,
is a maze measuring 51 feet across, which
has been carefully preserved by the local
authorities. At Chilcombe, near Winchester, a
maze is cut in the turf of S.&nbsp;Catherine’s Hill;
it is square in outline, each side being 86 feet.
It is locally known as the “Mize-maze.” One
much larger than any yet noticed is found
near Saffron Waldon, in Essex, its diameter
being 110 feet. There are local records which
prove the great antiquity of a maze at this place.
The design is peculiar, being properly a circle,
save that at four equal distances along the circumference
the pathway sweeps out into a horseshoe
projection.</p>

<p>A similar plan was followed in cutting a maze,
once of some celebrity, near S.&nbsp;Anne’s Well, at
Sneinton, Nottingham. The projections in this
case are bolder, and within the spaces enclosed
by the triple pathway which swept around them
were cut cross-crosslets. The popular names for
this maze in the district were the “Shepherd’s
<a name="p199" id="p199"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>199<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Maze,” and “Robin Hood’s Race.” This was,
unfortunately, ploughed up in 1797, at the enclosure
of the lordship of Sneinton. Nottinghamshire
has, however, another example in the small
square one at Clifton.</p>

 /><small>MAZE FORMERLY EXISTING NEAR ST. ANNE’S WELL, SNEINTON, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE.</small>
</div>

<p>Many of these turf-cut labyrinths were destroyed
during the Commonwealth, before which
<a name="p200" id="p200"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>200<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>period, according to Aubrey in his history of
Surrey, there were many in England. Not a few,
however, which survived that time of wanton
destruction, have been obliterated since.</p>

<p>In 1827 one which was on Ripon Common
was ploughed up. Its diameter was 60 feet.
Another existed till comparatively recent times
at Hillbury, between Farnham and Guildford.
At Pimpern, in Dorset, there was formerly a
maze of a unique design. The outline was
roughly a triangle, which enclosed nearly an acre
of ground; the pathway was marked out by
ridges of earth about a foot in height, and
followed a singularly intricate course. The
plough destroyed this also in 1730.</p>

<p>The names locally applied to these structures
often imply very erroneous ideas as to their
origin and purpose. In some instances they are
ascribed to the shepherds, as if cut by them as
pastime in their idle moments; a suggestion,
which a glance at the mazes themselves, with
their intricate designs and correctly formed
curves, will prove to be hardly tenable. Two
other names of frequent occurrence in England
are “Troy Town,” and “Julian’s Bower”; the
latter being connected with the former, Julius,
<a name="p201" id="p201"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>201<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>son of Æneas being the person alluded to.
Some have from these titles sought to trace a
connection with a very ancient sport known as
the <cite>Troy Game</cite>, which arose in classic times,
and survived down to the Middle Ages. It
consisted probably in the rhythmic<!-- TN: original reads "rythmic" -->
 performance
of certain evolutions, much after the fashion of
the “Musical Rides” executed by our cavalry.
The origin of the idea is to be sought in a
passage in Virgil’s Æneid (Bk.&nbsp;V., v.&nbsp;583 <i>et seq.</i>),
which has been thus translated by <span class="nw">Kennett:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width:26em;">
<div class="stanza">
<div> “Files facing files their bold companions dare,</div>
<div>  And wheel, and charge, and urge the sportive war.</div>
<div>  Now flight they feign, and naked backs expose,</div>
<div>  Now with turned spears drive headlong on the foes,</div>
<div>  And now, confederate grown, in peaceful ranks they close.</div>
<div>  As Crete’s fam’d labyrinth, to a thousand ways</div>
<div>  And endless darken’d walls the guest conveys;</div>
<div>  Endless, inextricable rounds amuse,</div>
<div>  And no kind track the doubtful passage shows;</div>
<div>  So the glad Trojan youth, the winding course</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Tresco, Scilly, has a maze known as Troy-town;
and it would seem that such were once
common in Cornwall, since any intricate arrangement
is often locally called by that name.</p>

<p>It has, however, been pointed out that
<a name="p202" id="p202"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>202<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>most of these mazes date from a time when
classical knowledge was not widely spread in
England; that, in fact, the name has probably
been given in most instances long after the date
of the construction of the work.</p>

<p>It would seem rather that the original use
of these quaint figures was, as with those
continental examples before noted, ecclesiastical.
No one who has had the opportunity of comparing
the designs of the English and the
foreign mazes can fail to be struck with the
great similarity between them; suggesting, at
least, a common origin and purpose. And this
suggestion is greatly strengthened when we notice
that, although the English mazes are never (with
one modern instance only excepted) within
churches, as are the continental instances, yet
they are almost invariably close to a church, or
the ancient site of a church. The Alkborough
and Wing mazes, for instance, are hard by the
parish churches; and those at Sneinton, Winchester,
and Boughton Green are beside spots
once consecrated by chapels dedicated in honour
of St. Anne, St. Catherine, and St. John. The
most probable conjecture is that these were
originally formed, and for long years were used,
<a name="p203" id="p203"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>203<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>for purposes of devotion and penance. Doubtless
in later times the children often trod those
mazy ways in sport and emulation, which had
been slowly measured countless times before in
silent meditation or in penitential tears.</p>

<p>A word or two may be added in conclusion on
mazes of the more modern sort, formed for
amusement rather than for use, as a curious
feature in a scheme of landscape gardening.
These <i>topiary</i> mazes, as they are called, usually
have their paths defined by walls of well-cut
box, yew, or other suitable shrubs; and they
differ from the turf mazes in that they are often
made purposely puzzling and misleading. In
the ecclesiastical maze, it is always the patience,
not the ingenuity, which is tested; there is but
one road to follow, and though that one wanders
in and out with tantalizing curves and coils, yet
it leads him who follows it unerringly to the
centre.</p>

<p>From Tudor times this form of decoration for
a large garden has been more or less popular.
Burleigh formed one at the old palace at
Theobald’s, Hertfordshire, about 1560; and the
Maze in Southwark, near a spot once occupied
by the residence of Queen Mary before coming
<a name="p204" id="p204"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>204<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>to the throne, and Maze Hill at Greenwich, no
doubt mark the sites of labyrinths now otherwise
forgotten. Lord Fauconbergh had a maze at
Sutton Court in 1691; and William&nbsp;III. so
highly approved of them that, having left one
behind him at the Palace of the Loo, he had
another constructed at Hampton Court.</p>

<p>Literature and art have not disdained to
interest themselves in this somewhat formal
method of gardening; for in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries more than one treatise on
their construction was published; while Holbein
and Tintoretto have left behind them designs
for topiary labyrinths.</p>

<p>The oldest and most famous maze in our
history is “Fair Rosamond’s Bower,” already
mentioned. Of what kind this was, if indeed it
was at all, it is difficult to say; authorities
disagreeing as to whether it was a matter of
architectural arrangement, of connected caves, or
of some other kind. The trend of modern historical
criticism in this, as in so many other
romantic stories from our annals, is to deny its
genuineness altogether.</p>

<p>Fortunately although so many of our ancient
mazes have disappeared, the designs of their
<a name="p205" id="p205"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>205<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>construction has, in not a few cases, been
preserved to us by means of contemporary
drawings; so that a fairly accurate idea of the
type most commonly followed may still be
obtained.</p>

<p>We have to thank Mr. J.&nbsp;Potter Briscoe,

 /></span></span>Churchyard Superstitions.</h2>

<p class="author">By the Rev. Theodore Johnson.</p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">Among</span> all classes of English people there
are mixed feelings relating to our churchyards.
They are either places of reverence on the
one hand, or superstition on the other. The sacred
plot surrounding the old Parish Church carries
with it such a host of memories and associations,
that to the learned and thoughtful it has always
been God’s Acre, hallowed with a tender hush of
silent contemplation of the many sad rifts and
partings among us. We almost vie with each
other in proclaiming that deep reverence for this
one sacred spot, so dear to our family life, and
affections, by those mementos of love which we
raise over the resting-places of our lost ones gone
before. This is strangely apparent in the stately
monument, where the carver’s art declares the
virtues of the dead, either by sculptured figure,
or verse engraven, as well as in the ofttimes more
pathetic, and perhaps more beautiful, tribute of
the floral cross or wreath culled by loving hands,
and borne in silence, by our poorer brethren, as
<a name="p207" id="p207"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>207<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the only offering, or tribute, their slender means
allows them to make. Be sure of this one fact,
that our English Churchyards are better kept&mdash;more
worthy of the name of God’s Acre than
in the times past, for what is a more beautiful
sight, than to see the kneeling children around
the garden grave of a parent, or a child companion,
adorning the little mound with flowers
for the Eastertide festival. Here we have
a living illustration of the truth of the concluding
words of our Great Creed: “I look for the
Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the
World to come.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, to the ignorant, and unlearned
in these things, the Churchyard often
becomes a place of dread, and it may be, some of
the strange behaviour sometimes seen there
arises from this inner feeling of awe, which in
their ignorant superstition they are wont to carry
off in the spirit of daring bravado.</p>

<p>From a close study of the subject, I am led
to conclude that the common unchristian idea,
that the churchyard is ‘haunted,’ whatever that
may mean to a weak or ignorant person, has
much to do with it. The evil report, once
circulated, will be handed on to generations yet
<a name="p208" id="p208"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>208<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>unborn, until the simple origin, which at first
might have been easily explained, becomes
clouded in mystery as time goes on, and the
deep rooted feeling of horror spreads around us,
until even the more strong-minded among us, feel
at times, somewhat doubtful as to whether there
may not be some truth where the popular testimony
is so strong.</p>

<p>In country districts, more than in towns,
superstition is rife with regard to our Churchyards.
The variety and form of this superstition
is well nigh ‘Legion,’ and though many of my
readers may enjoy an Ingoldsby experience
when read in a well-lighted room, surrounded by
smiling companions, few of them, after such an
experience would care to pay a visit alone to
some neighbouring churchyard, renowned for its
tale of ghostly appearances. This will, I think
enable me to show that by far the larger number
of churchyard superstitions are purely chimerous
fancies of the brain, and do not owe their origin,
or existence, to any other source, be that source
a wilful fraud, or imposition, designed to produce
fear, or merely the imaginative delusion of some
overstrained, or weak brain, which called first it
into existence.</p>


<p><a name="p209" id="p209"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>209<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Yet there are prevalent ideas or notions, about
the churchyard and its sleepers, as deep-rooted
as any wild superstition, and perhaps as difficult
to solve, or to trace to any rational source. I
would here mention one of the most strange, and
probably one of the most prejudiced notions to
be met with relating to burial in the churchyard.
I refer to the East Anglian prejudice of being
buried on the north side of the church. That
this prejudice is a strong one, among the country
people in certain parts of England, is proved by
the scarcity of graves, nay, in many instances the
total absence of graves, on the north side of our
churches.</p>

<p>Some seventeen years ago, shortly after taking
charge of a parish in Norfolk, I was called upon
to select a suitable spot for the burial of a poor
man, who had been killed by an accident. After
several places had been suggested by me to the
sexton, who claimed for them either a family
right, or some similar objection; I noticed for the
first time, that there were no graves upon the
north side of the church, and I, in my innocence,
suggested that there would be plenty of space
there; whereupon my companion’s face at once
assumed the most serious expression, and I
<a name="p210" id="p210"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>210<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>immediately saw that fear had taken hold of his
mind, as he answered with a somewhat shaky
voice, “No, Sir! No, that cannot be!” My
curiosity was immediately aroused, and I sought
for an explanation, which I found not from my
good and loyal friend, who would not trust
himself to answer further than “No, Sir! No,
that cannot be!” The sexton’s manner puzzled
me greatly, for the man was an upright, straightforward,
open-hearted, servant of the Church&mdash;but
I at once saw that it would be fruitless
to push the matter further with him, so after
marking out a suitable resting place for the poor
unfortunate man, who not being a parishoner of
long standing, had no family burial place awaiting
him, I made my way home to think over the
whole occurrence.</p>

<p>The cause for non-burial on the north side of
the Church was indeed a mystery, yet that my
parishoners had some valid reason for not being
laid to rest there, was apparent; so I set about
the task of unravelling the superstition, if so it
may be called.</p>

<p>My library shelves seemed to be the most natural
place of research, but here after consultation
with several volumes of Archæology, Ecclesiology,
<a name="p211" id="p211"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and Folk Lore, I could find nothing bearing upon
the subject, beyond that in certain instances
relating to Churchyard Parishes on the sea-coast,
the north side by reason of its exposure to wind
and storm, and being the sunless quarter of the
burying ground, was less used than other parts;
but here the reason given was in consideration of
the living mourners at the time of the interment,
and not the body sleeping in its last resting
place of earth.</p>

<p>After some considerable correspondence with
friends likely to be interested in such a matter,
I was rewarded with information that, in some
instances, the northern portion of the churchyard
was left unconsecrated, and only thus occasionally
used for the burial of suicides, vagrants,
highwaymen (after the four cross road graves
had been discontinued<!-- TN: original reads "discontined" -->), or for nondescripts and
unbaptised persons, for whom no religious service
was considered necessary. Even this I did not
accept as a solution of my problem. That there
was something more than local feeling underlying
this superstition, I was certain, but how to
get to the root of the subject perplexed me.</p>

<p>The Editor of “Notes and Queries” could
not satisfy me. His general suggestions and
<a name="p212" id="p212"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>212<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>kind desire to aid me were well-nigh fruitless,
so that there remained for me the course of
watching and waiting, as none of my neighbours
could, or would, go beyond the conclusive
statement of the sexton, “It must not be!” or
what was even more indefinite, “I have never
heard of such a thing.”</p>

<p>The subject was a fruitful source of thought
for some months, and in vain I tried to connect
some religious custom of other days, or to find
some Text of Scripture, which might have given
rise to the idea, if mistranslated, or twisted by
human ingenuity, to serve such a purpose, but
none occurred to me that in the least would bear
of such a contortion.</p>

<p>In my intercourse with my older parishoners I
sought in vain to test the unbaptized or suicidal
burying place theory as suggested above, but
this was entirely foreign to them. At length, the
truth of the old saying, “<cite>All things come to those
who wait</cite>” brought its due reward. I was called
in to visit an aged parishoner, who was nearing
the end of life’s journey, and among other
subjects naturally came the thoughts, and wishes,
of this old saintly man’s last hours on earth.
He had been a shepherd for well nigh sixty
<a name="p213" id="p213"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>years, and a widower for the past fifteen years,
and in consequence he had lived and worked
much alone. This had produced a thoughtful
spirit, and a certain slowness of speech, so that
he was quite the last man I should have consulted
for a solution of my mystery. Yet, here the
secret was unfolded, or to my mind more
satisfactorily explained, than by any previous
consultation with either men or books. The
grand old labourer, or faithful shepherd, as he
was laid helpless on his bed, with his life work
symbol&mdash;the shepherd’s crook, standing idle in
the corner, and his trusty dog, restless and
perplexed, roaming from room to room, was a
wonderful picture of a Christian death-bed.</p>

<p>There I learned many a solemn life-lesson
never to be forgotten. The calm voice, the monosyllabic
answers given in response to my questions
are still fresh to me; and there I learned the
source of my Churchyard Superstition in the
following <span class="nw">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>With a strange, weird, unnatural light in the
aged man’s eyes, which portrayed much anxiety
of mind, he spoke about his burial-place, and
particularly emphasising the words “<em>On the south
side, sir, near by the wife</em>.” When I ventured to
<a name="p214" id="p214"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>214<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>inquire if he knew why such a strong objection
was held to burial on the north side of the
church. He started suddenly, and I shall never
forget his reproachful, sad look as he more
readily than usual gave the <span class="nw">answer:&mdash;</span>“The left
side of Christ, sir: we don’t like to be counted
among the goats.”</p>

<p>As a flash of lightning illuminates the whole
darkness of the country side, and reveals for the
moment every object in clear outline, so this
quaint saying of my dying friend dispelled in a
moment the mists of the past which clouded the
truth of my strange superstition.</p>

<p>Here was the best answer to the mystery,
pointing with no uncertain words to the glorious
Resurrection Day, this aged, earthly shepherd at
the end of his years of toil recognised his Great
Master, Jesus, as the True Shepherd of mankind,
meeting His flock as they arose from their long
sleep of death, with their faces turned eastward,
awaiting His appearing.</p>

<p>Then when all had been called and recognised
He turned to lead them onward, still their True
Shepherd and Guide, with the sheep on His
right hand, and the goats on His left hand, so
wonderfully foretold in the Gospel story:
<a name="p215" id="p215"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>215<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>“When the Son of Man shall come in His glory,
and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He
sit upon the throne of His glory; And before
Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall
separate them one from another, as a shepherd
divideth his sheep from the goats: and He shall
set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats
on the left.”&mdash;<i>S.&nbsp;Matt, xxv., 31, 32, 33.</i></p>

<p>Surely, the above simple illustration explains
much that is difficult and mysterious to us in the
way of religious superstition. Undoubtedly, we
have here a good example of how superstitions
have arisen, probably from a good source, it may
be the words of some teacher long since passed
away. The circumstance has long been forgotten,
yet the lesson remains, and being handed
down by oral tradition only, every vestige of its
religious nature disappears and but the feeling
remains, which, in the minds of the ignorant
populace, increases in mystery and enfolds itself
in superstitious awe, without any desire from
them to discover the origin, or source, of such
a strange custom, or event.</p>

<p class="author">By the Rev. R. Wilkins Rees.</p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">Years</span> ago announcements in churches were
of a distinctly curious character, and the
parish clerk in making the intimation seems
to have been left completely to his own indiscretion.
In country districts, where proper
advertising would be quite impossible, the
practical advantages of some classes of announcements
would be great, but none of them accord
with our modern sense of the fitness of things,
and many can only be accounted for on the
ground of extraordinary familiarity between
clergyman, clerk, and congregation. A brief
consideration of the subject furnishes a few
side-lights into the general condition of the
church, as well as into the laxity of church
discipline, about fifty years and more ago, especially
away from large centres of population.</p>

<p>In certain parts, the custom of crying lost
goods in church was undoubtedly prevalent, and
did not then appear peculiar. The rector, who
had lost his favourite dog and told the parish
<a name="p217" id="p217"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>217<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>clerk to do his best to ascertain its whereabouts,
may have been astonished to hear him announce
the loss in church, coupled with a statement that
a reward of three pounds would be given to the
person who should restore the animal to its
owner. But such surprise was hardly natural
when an announcement like the following was
<span class="nw">possible:&mdash;</span>“Mislaid on Sunday last! The gold-rimmed
vicar’s spectacles of best glass, taken
from his eyes in going into the poor box, or put
down somewhere when going into the font to
fetch the water after the christening.” What a
shock this rare jumble produced by a country
clerk must have been to the precise and classical
vicar can only be imagined. The thought,
however, of a gold-rimmed vicar diminutive
enough to enter font or poor box is somewhat
staggering! Quite as muddled, but much more
ingenious, was the clerk who announced, in
recent years, an accomplished D.Sc. and LL.D.
as a Doctor of Schools and a Lord Lieutenant
of Divinity!</p>

<p>“Lost, stolen, or strayed,” shouted the clerk
in church one Sunday, with the strident voice of
a town crier, and the manner of one not unaccustomed
to the task, “lost, stolen, or strayed.
<a name="p218" id="p218"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>218<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Four fat sheep and one lean cow. Whoever will
return the same to Mr. <span class="nw">&mdash;&mdash;’s</span> farm will be
suitably rewarded.” It is well that the name of
the parish in which it was given, is missing from
another specimen of this sort of announcement,
for it seems to indicate that honesty there could
be but the outcome of an inducement afforded
by the promise of substantial reward. “Lost,”
said the clerk, “on Sunday last, when the wearer
was walking home from this church, and before
she reached the Town Hall, a lady’s gold brooch,
set with pearls and other precious stones. The
one who has found it will consider it worth while
to restore it, for the reward of a guinea is
offered.”</p>

<p>It is not a little surprising<!-- TN: original reads "suprising" --> that the clergyman
in charge did not supervise more carefully the
various announcements, especially when so many
a <i>contretemps</i> occurred. Once a parish clerk
announced in his rector’s <span class="nw">hearing:&mdash;</span>“There’ll be
no service next Sunday as the rector’s going out
grouse shooting.” The rector had injudiciously
acquainted his clerk with the reason of his
approaching absence, and this was the result.
It happened, of course, a half century since, but
it illustrates an interesting state of things as
<a name="p219" id="p219"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>219<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>existing at that period. With it two similar
incidents may well be mentioned, the first of
which occurred in Scotland, the second in the
Principality. “Next Sawbath,” said a worthy
Scotch beadle, “we shall have no Sawbath, for
the meenister’s house is having spring cleaning,
and as the weather is very bad the meenister’s
wife wants the kirk to dry the things in.” “Next
Sunday,” declared the unconsciously amusing
Welshman, “there’ll be no Sunday, as we’re
going to whitewash the church with yellow-ochre.”
Sometimes the omission of a stop
caused sore trouble to the clerk, while it hugely
delighted the congregation. “A man having
gone to see his wife desires the prayers of this
church,” was the startling announcement. But
had not the clerk been near-sighted and mistaken
<em>sea</em> for <em>see</em>, and had a comma been supplied after
sea, the notice would have been all right, for it
was simply the request of a sailor’s wife on behalf
of her husband.</p>

<p>Once the clerk made the announcement that a
parish meeting would be held on a given date.
“No, no,” interrupted the vicar. “D’ye think
I’d attend to business on the audit day!” The
audit days were recognised as times of hearty
<a name="p220" id="p220"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>220<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>feasting and convivial mirth, in which the vicar
played no unimportant part. This freedom of
speech between clergyman and clerk was not
seldom fruitful of ill-restrained amusement when
the announcements were made. A vicar informed
his congregation one Sunday morning that he
would hold the customary service for baptisms in
the afternoon, and requested the parents to bring
their children punctually, so that there might be
no delay in commencing. Immediately he had
said this, the old clerk, sleepy and deaf, thinking
the parson’s announcement had to do with a new
hymn-book which at that time was being introduced,
arose, and graciously informed the people
that for those who were still without them he had
a stock in the vestry from which they could be
supplied at the low charge of eighteenpence each.
This is slightly <span class="nw">similar:&mdash;</span>“I publish the banns
of marriage between ... between ...”
announced a clergyman from the pulpit. But
here for a moment he stopped, as the book in
which were the notices was not to be seen. The
clerk, seeing his vicar’s predicament, and catching
sight of the whereabouts of the missing book,
<span class="nw">ejaculated:&mdash;</span>“Between the cushion and the
desk, sir.” The unique character of another
<a name="p221" id="p221"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>221<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>notice will fully justify its inclusion. “I am
unwell, my friends, very unwell,” announced a
preacher one Sunday evening, “and therefore I
shall dispense with my usual gesticulation.”
This happened not very long ago.</p>

<p>So disregarded, indeed, were the proprieties of
worship a generation since, that the clergyman
would sometimes pause during the delivery of his
sermon and make an announcement which, to
say the least of it, had no connection with the
theme he was pursuing. Thus the Rev. Samuel
Sherwen, a well-known cleric in Cumberland,
announced one morning that he had just caught
sight, through a window near the pulpit, of some
cows in a cornfield, and requested that some one
would go and drive them out. At another time
he said there were some pigs in the churchyard
which were not his, and his servant Peter would
do well to expel the intruders. Very probably
such announcements, though made from a pulpit,
would be excused because they resulted in a
certain benefit. The same plea could undoubtedly
be put forward for the following trio, each
of which hails from beyond the Severn. “Take
notice!” exclaimed the clerk. “A thief is going
through the Vale of Glamorgan selling tin ware,
<a name="p222" id="p222"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>222<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>false gold, trinkets, and rings, and other domestic
implements and instruments, and robbing houses
of hens, chickens, eggs, butter, and other portable
animals, making all sorts of pretences to get
money!” Again, “Beware! beware! of a man
with one eye, talking like a preacher, and a
wooden leg, given to begging and stealing!”
And once more, “Take notice! take notice!
there’s a mad dog going the round of the parish
with two crop ears and a very long tail!”
Surely the intention of such announcements was
good, even though the literary form was bad.
The last, as might be inferred, was made at a
time when rabies were prevalent.</p>

<p>The Rev. Samuel Sherwen, already alluded
to, was surpassed in this direction by another
Cumbrian clergyman, the Rev. William Sewell,
of Troutbeck. One Sunday morning the latter
entered the pulpit of the little church at Wythburn
to preach. The pulpit sadly needed repair,
and, in leaning out from the wall, left an undesirable
opening behind it. Into this chink
the parson’s sermon fell, and the pulpit was so
ricketty in its broken-down condition that the
preacher feared the consequences of turning in
it. Moreover, the manuscript had fallen so far
<a name="p223" id="p223"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>223<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>that it could not be reached. Mr. Sewell, bereft
of his sermon, announced to his congregation in
broad dialect: “T’ sarmont’s slipt down i’ t’
neuk, and I can’t git it out; but I’ll tell ye what&mdash;I’se
read ye a chapter i’ t’ Bible ’at’s worth
three on’t.” A similar story is told in connection
with the Rev. Mr. Alcock, who in the middle
of the last century was rector of Burnsal, near
Skipton, in Yorkshire. Of this clergyman another
story is given which well illustrates the excessive
familiarity indulged in by occupants of the pulpit
in bygone days. One of his friends, at whose
house he was wont to call previous to entering
the church on Sundays, seized a chance to
unfasten and then misplace the leaves of his
sermon. In the service the parson had not read
far before he discovered the trick. “Will,” cried
he, “thou rascal! what’s thou been doing with
my sermon?” Then turning to his people, he
continued: “Brethren, Will Thornton’s been
misplacing the leaves of my sermon; I have not
time to put them right; I shall read on as I find
it, and you must make the best of it that you
can.” He accordingly read to the close of the
confused mass to the utter astonishment of his
congregation.</p>

<p><a name="p224" id="p224"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>224<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Of such familiarity Scottish churches furnish
well-nigh innumerable instances. One or two
will, however, be sufficient for my purpose. The
clergyman who was expected to conduct the
morning service had not made his appearance at
the appointed time. After a dreadful suspense
of some fifteen minutes the beadle, that much-privileged
individual, entered the church,
marched slowly along the accustomed passage,
and mounted the pulpit-stair. When half-way
up he stopped, turned to the congregation, and
thus addressed them: “There was one Alexander
to hae preached here the day, but he’s neither
come hissel; nor has he sent the scrape o’ a pen
to say what’s come owre him. Ye’d better keep
your seats for anither ten meenits to see whether
the body turns up or no. If he disna come,
there’s naething for ’t but for ye a’ to gang hame
again an’ say naething mair aboot it. The like
o’ this hasna happened here syne I hae been
conneckit wi’ the place, an’ that’s mair than four-and-thirty
year now.” As an announcement to
the point, and for the purpose, that could not
easily be beaten. A clergyman of Crossmichael,
in Galloway, would even intersperse his lessons
or sermon with any announcement that might
<a name="p225" id="p225"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>225<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>at the moment occur to him, or with allusions to
the behaviour of his hearers. Once, because of
this method, a verse from Exodus was hardly
recognisable. The version given was as follows:
“And the Lord said unto Moses&mdash;shut that
door; I’m thinkin’ if ye had to sit beside that
door yersel’, ye wadna be sae ready leavin’ it
open; it was just beside that door that Yedam
Tamson, the bellman, gat his death o’ cauld, an’
I’m sure, honest man, he didna lat it stey muckle
open.&mdash;And the Lord said unto Moses&mdash;put oot
that dog; wha is’t that brings dogs to the kirk,
yaff-yaffin’? Lat me never see ye bring yer dogs
here ony mair, for, if ye do, tak notice, I’ll put
you an’ them baith oot.&mdash;And the Lord said
unto Moses&mdash;I see a man aneeth that wast laft
wi’ his hat on; I’m sure ye’re cleen oot o’ the
souch o’ the door; keep aff yer bonnet, Tammas,
an’ if yer bare pow be cauld, ye maun jist get a
grey worset wig like mysel’; they’re no sae dear;
plenty o’ them at Bob Gillespie’s for tenpence.”
At last, however, the preacher informed his
hearers what was said to Moses in a manner at
once more accurate and becoming.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a usual custom for the clergyman
publicly to rebuke offenders, as when it
<a name="p226" id="p226"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>226<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>happened that a young man, sitting in a prominent
position in the church, pulled out his
handkerchief and brought with it a bundle of
playing cards, which flew in every direction.
He had, so it turned out, been up late the previous
night, and had stuffed the cards with which he
had been gambling into his pocket, where they
had remained forgotten. The people were
amazed and horrified, but the clergyman simply
looked at the offender and remarked with quiet,
yet most withering sarcasm, “Sir, that prayer
book of yours has been badly bound!” But
some times the rebuke was deftly thrust back
upon the preacher. “You’re sleepy, John,”
said the clergyman, pausing in the middle of a
drowsy discourse, and looking hard at the man
he thus addressed. “Take some snuff, John.”
“Put the snuff in the sermon,” ejaculated John;
and the faces of the audience showed that the
retort was fully appreciated.</p>

<p>In fact, such was the freedom tolerated, that
this incident in Eskdale might be taken as an
example. Someone walked noisily up the aisle
during divine service. “Whaa’s tat?” asked
the clergyman in a tone quite loud enough to
rebuke the offender. “It’s aad Sharp o’ Laa
<a name="p227" id="p227"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>227<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Birker,” responded the clerk. “Afooat or o’
horseback?” was the significant query. “Nay,”
was the answer, “nobbet afooat, wi’ cokert shun”
(calkered shoes). Frequently the clerk would
interrupt the clergyman, and the interruption
would not enhance the devotional character of
the service. In a rural parish church a new
pitch-pipe was provided, but the clerk had not
tested it before entering his desk on the Sunday,
and when he should have given the key-note the
instrument could not be adjusted. The clerk
tugged at it, thrust it in, gave it several thumps,
made sundry grimaces, but the pipe was obdurate.
“My friends,” announced the impatient
parson, “the pitch-pipe will not work, so let us
pray.” “Pray!” snorted the aggrieved official,
“pray! no, no, we’ll pray none till I put this
thing aright.” And members of the congregation
would even stand up in their pews to
contradict the parson or clerk when making the
announcement. “There will be a service here
as usual on Thursday evening next,” announced
the clerk one Sunday morning. “No, there
won’t,” declared the churchwarden as he rose
from his seat. “We be going to carry hay all
day Thursday.” “But the service will be held
<a name="p228" id="p228"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>228<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>as usual,” asserted the clerk. But the churchwarden
was not to be thwarted. “Then there’ll
be nobody here,” said he. “D’ye think we’re
coming to church and leave the hay in the fields?
No, no, p’r’aps it’ll rain Friday.”</p>

<p>But of all amusing instances of curious announcements
in church those given by the Rev.
Cuthbert Bede in <cite>All the Year Round</cite>, November
1880, may take the palm and fittingly conclude
this chapter. “An old rector of a small country
parish,” so runs the story, “had sent his
set of false teeth to be repaired, on the
understanding that they should be returned
“by Saturday” as there was no Sunday
post, and the village was nine miles from the
post town. The old rector tried to brave out the
difficulty, but after he had incoherently mumbled
through the prayers, he decided not to address
his congregation on that day. While the hymn
was being sung, he summoned the clerk to the
vestry, and then said to him: “It is quite useless
for me to attempt to go on. The fact is,
that my dentist has not sent me back my artificial
teeth, and it is impossible for me to make
myself understood. You must tell the congregation
that the service is ended for this morning,
<a name="p229" id="p229"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>229<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and that there will be no service this afternoon.”
The old clerk went back to his desk; the singing
of the hymn was brought to an end; and the
rector, from the vestry, heard the clerk address
the congregation thus: “This is to give notice!
as there won’t be no sarmon nor no more sarvice
this mornin’, so you’ better all go whum (home);
and there won’t be no sarvice this aternoon, as
the rector ain’t got his artful teeth back from the
dentist!”</p>

 /></span></span>Big Bones Preserved in Churches.</h2>

<p class="author">By the Rev. R. Wilkins Rees.</p>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">In</span> a lovely and secluded valley in Montgomeryshire
is situated the interesting old
church of Pennant Melangell, of whose foundation
a charming legend is told. The romantic
glen was in the first instance the retreat of a
beautiful Irish maiden, Monacella (in Welsh,
Melangell), who had fled from her father’s court
rather than wed a noble to whom he had promised
her hand, that here she might alone “serve God
and the spotless virgin.” Brochwell Yscythrog,
Prince of Powys, being one day hare-hunting in
the locality, pursued his game till he came to
a thicket, where to his amazement he found a
lady of surpassing beauty, with the hare he was
chasing safely sheltered beneath her robe. Notwithstanding
all the efforts of the sportsman to
make them seize their prey, the dogs had retired
to a distance, howling as though in fear, and
even when the huntsman essayed to blow his
horn, it stuck to his lips. The Prince, learning
the lady’s story, right royally assigned to her the
<a name="p231" id="p231"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>231<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>spot as a sanctuary for ever to all who fled there.
It afterwards became a safe asylum for the
oppressed, and an institution for the training of
female devotees. But how long it so continued
cannot be said. Monacella’s hard bed used to
be shown in the cleft of a neighbouring rock,
while her tomb was in a little oratory adjoining
the church.</p>

<p>In the church is to be found carved woodwork,
which doubtless once formed part of the rood-loft,
representing the legend of Saint Melangell.
The protection afforded by the saint to the hare
gave such animals the name of Wyn Melangell&mdash;St.
Monacella’s lambs&mdash;and the superstition was
so fully credited that no person would kill a hare
in the parish, while it was also believed that if
anyone cried “God and St. Monacella be with
thee” after a hunted hare, it would surely escape.</p>

<p>The church contains another interesting item
in the shape of a large bone, more than four feet
long, which has been described as the bone of
the patron saint. Southey visited the church,
and in an amusing rhyming letter addressed to
his daughter, thus refers to it: “’Tis a church
in a vale, whereby hangs a tale, how a hare being
pressed by the dogs was much distressed, the
<a name="p232" id="p232"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>232<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>hunters coming nigh and the dogs in full cry,
looked about for someone to defend her, and saw
just in time, as it now comes pat in rhyme, a
saint of the feminine gender. The saint was
buried there, and a figure carved with care, in
the churchyard is shown, as being her own;
but ’tis used for a whetstone (like a stone at our
back door), till the pity is the more (I should say
the more’s the pity, if it suited with my ditty),
it is whetted half away&mdash;lack-a-day, lack-a-day!
They show a mammoth rib (was there ever such
a fib?) as belonging to the saint Melangell. It
was no use to wrangle, and tell the simple people
that if this had been her bone, she must certainly
have grown to be three times as tall as the
steeple!”</p>

<p>In Lewis’s “Topographical Dictionary of
Wales” (1843), we are told that on the mountain
between Bala and Pennant Melangell was
found a large bone named the Giant’s Rib,
perhaps the bone of some fish, now kept in the
church. But where the bone came from it is
quite impossible to say. Old superstitions have
clung to it, and beyond what tradition furnishes
there is practically nothing for our guidance.</p>

<p>It is somewhat strange that in the same
<a name="p233" id="p233"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>233<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>county, in connection with the church at
Mallwyd, other bones are exhibited. Of this
church, surrounded by romantic scenery, the
Dr.&nbsp;Davies, who rendered into Welsh the
Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England,
and assisted Bishop Perry in the translation of
the Bible, was for many years incumbent. The
sacred edifice was far-famed for its magnificent
yew trees, and for the position of the communion
table in the centre. Archbishop Laud issued
orders that it should be placed at the east end,
but Dr.&nbsp;Davies defied the prelate, and restored
it to its old position, where, according to
Hemmingway’s “Panorama of North Wales,”
in which the church was described as a “humble
Gothic structure, the floor covered with rushes,”
it remained till 1848. It is not, however, so placed
now. Over the porch of this church some bones
are suspended, but no palæontologist has yet
decided as to their origin. It has been said that
they are the rib and part of the spine of a whale
caught in the Dovey in bygone days! Whatever
may be the truth, however, it is not now to be
ascertained, but must remain shrouded in mystery
with that concerning the bones at Pennant
Melangell. The bones were in their present
<a name="p234" id="p234"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>234<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>position in 1816, for they are then mentioned by
Pugh in his <cite>Cambria Depicta</cite>.</p>

<p>England has several instances of big bones
preserved in churches, and one story seems to be
told regarding almost all. A most interesting
example is to be found over one of the altar
tombs in the Foljambe Chapel, Chesterfield
Church. This bone, supposed to be the jawbone
of a small whale, is seven feet four inches in
length, and about thirteen inches, on an average,
in circumference. Near one end is engraved, in
old English characters, the name “Thomas
Fletcher.” The Foljambes disposed of their
manor in 1633 to the Ingrams, who in turn sold
it to the Fletchers, and thus the name on the
bone is accounted for. A generally-accepted
explanation about this bone&mdash;not even disbelieved
entirely at the present day&mdash;was that it formed a
rib of the celebrated Dun Cow of Dunsmore
Heath, killed by the doughty Guy of Warwick,
with whom local tradition identified the warrior
whose marble effigy lies beneath the bone, sent
to Chesterfield to celebrate the much-appreciated
victory.</p>

“it was revealed to Eadmer, a virtuous man,
that he should be carried to Dunholme, where
he should find a place of rest.  His followers
were in distress, not knowing where Dunholme
lay; but as they proceeded, a woman, wanting
her cow, called aloud to her companion to know
if she had seen her, when the other answered
that she was in Dunholme.  This was happy
news to the distressed monks, who thereby
knew that their journey’s end was at hand,
and the saint’s body near its resting-place.”
It has been said that the after riches of the
See of Durham gave rise to the proverb, “The
dun cow’s milk makes the prebend’s wives go
in silk.”</p>

<p>But to return to the dun cow slain by Guy.
That the champion was credited of old with
having overcome some such animal is evident
from the matter-of-fact fashion in which it is
recorded by ancient chroniclers.  In Percy’s
“Reliques of Antient Poetry,” occur the following
verses in a black-letter ballad which sings the
exploits of <span class="nw">Guy:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width:20em;">

</div>

<p>A circumstantial account is given in the
“Noble and Renowned History of Guy, Earl of
Warwick,” as translated from the curious old
French black-letter volume in Warwick Castle,
and of this a somewhat modernised version may
be submitted. “Fame made known in every
corner of the land that a dun cow of enormous
size, ‘at least four yards in height, and six in
length, and a head proportionable,’ was making
dreadful devastations, and destroying man and
beast. The king was at York when he heard of
the havoc and slaughter which this monstrous
animal had made. He offered knighthood to
anyone who would destroy her, and many
lamented the absence in Normandy of Guy,
who, hearing of the beast, went privately to give
it battle. With bow and sword and axe he came,
and found every village desolate, every cottage
empty. His heart filled with compassion, and
<a name="p239" id="p239"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>239<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>he waited for the encounter. The furious beast
glared at him with her eyes of fire. His arrows
flew from her sides as from adamant itself. Like
the wind from the mountain side the beast came
on. Her horns pierced his armour of proof,
though his mighty battle-axe struck her in the
forehead. He wheeled his gallant steed about
and struck her again. He wounded her behind
the ear. The monster roared and snorted as she
felt the anguish of the wound. At last she fell,
and Guy, alighting, hewed at her until she
expired, deluged with her blood. He then rode
to the next town, and made known the monster’s
death, and then went to his ship, hoping to sail
before the king could know of the deed. Fame
was swifter than Guy. The king sent for him,
gave him the honour of knighthood, and caused
one of the ribs of the cow to be hung up in
Warwick Castle, where it remains until this
day.” Old Dr.&nbsp;Caius, of Cambridge, writes of
having seen an enormous head at Warwick
Castle in 1552, and also “a vertebra of the neck
of the same animal, of such great size that its
circumference is not less than three Roman
feet seven inches and a half.” He thinks also
that “the blade-bone, which is to be seen hung
<a name="p240" id="p240"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>240<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>up by chains form the north gate of Coventry,
belongs to the same animal.  The circumference
of the whole bone is not less than eleven feet
four inches and a half.”  The same authority
further states that “in the chapel of the great
Guy, Earl of Warwick, which is situated rather
more than a mile from the town of Warwick
(Guy’s Cliff), there is hung up a rib of the same
animal, as I suppose, the girth of which in the
smallest part is nine inches, the length six feet
and a half,” and he inclines to a half-belief, at
any rate, in the Dun-Cow story.</p>

<p>In connection with the legend it should be
mentioned that in the north-west of Shropshire is
the Staple Hill, which has a ring of upright
stones, about ninety feet in diameter, of the rude
pre-historic type. “Here the voice of fiction
declares there formerly dwelt a giant who guarded
his cow within this inclosure, like another Apis
among the ancient Egyptians, a cow who yielded
her milk as miraculously as the bear Œdumla,
whom we read of in Icelandic mythology, filling
every vessel that could be brought to her, until
at length an old crone attempted to catch her
milk in a sieve, when, furious at the insult, she
broke out of the magical inclosure and wandered
<a name="p241" id="p241"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>241<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>into Warwickshire, where her subsequent history
and fate are well known under that of the Dun
Cow, whose death added another wreath of
laurel to the immortal Guy, Earl of Warwick.”
The presence of bones at Chesterfield and elsewhere
is, of course, accounted for by the fact (?)
that they were distributed over the country so
that in various places Guy’s marvellous feat
might be commemorated.</p>

<p>In Queen Elizabeth’s “fairest and most famous
parish church in England,” St. Mary Redcliff,
Bristol, is preserved a bone said to have belonged
to a monster cow which once supplied the whole
city with milk. Bristolians, proud of their
connection with the great discoverer, Cabot,
assert that it is a whalebone brought to the city
by the illustrious voyager on his return from
Newfoundland. But here the story of Guy of
Warwick and the cow has also been introduced.
The bone, which is now fixed not far from the
stair leading to the chamber containing the
muniment chest where Chatterton pretended to
have found the Rowley poems, was formerly
hung within the church, while near to it was
suspended a grimy old picture now banished to
a position on a staircase just where the room in
<a name="p242" id="p242"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>242<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>which the vestry meetings are held is entered.
The picture, so far as it can be made out,
contains a big figure of a man on the right hand
side, while in the foreground lies a prostrate man,
behind whom stands a cow.  To the left of the
picture are certain human figures in attitudes
expressive of surprise.  This ancient painting
was said to refer to Guy’s exploit, and the rib
was pointed out as a positive proof that the
daring deed was done.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that all, or nearly all,
these bones preserved in churches are those of
whales, though in some instances they have been
supposed to be those of the wild <span class="postnomial">BONASUS</span> or
<span class="postnomial">URUS</span> and most are associated in some way or
other with the legend of Guy and the Dun-Cow.
Indeed, it seems almost strange that the story
has not been connected even with the bone at
Pennant Melangell, especially as on the mountain
between Llanwddyn and the parish is a circular
inclosure surrounded by a wall called Hên Eglwys,
and supposed to be a Druidical relic, which would
have been just the spot to have lent itself to the
statement that there the animal was confined.</p>

<p>The late Frank Buckland, in his entertaining
chapter on “A Hunt on the Sea-Shore,” in his
<a name="p243" id="p243"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>243<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>second volume of “Curiosities of Natural History,”
says: “Whale-bones get to odd places,”
and writes of having seen them used for a grotto
in Abingdon, and a garden chair in Clapham.
Not far from Chesterfield there were, until recently,
some whale-jaw gate posts which formed
an arch, and in North Lincolnshire such bones,
tall and curved, are still to be seen serving similar
purposes. But the presence of such bones,
carefully preserved in churches, though it may
occasion considerable conjecture, cannot, it
seems, be properly explained. As yet, at any
rate, the riddle remains unsolved.</p>

<h2 class="chapanon" title="Samuel Pepys at Church"><a name="p244" id="p244"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>244<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Samuel Pepys at Church.</h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">The</span> Diary of Samuel Pepys, from 1659 to
1669, presents us with a picture of London
in the days of Charles&nbsp;II. that has perhaps not
been equalled in any other work dealing with the
manners, customs, and the social life of the
period. We get a good idea from it how Sunday
was spent in an age largely given to pleasure.
Samuel Pepys had strong leanings towards the
Presbyterians, but was a churchman, and seldom
missed going to a place of worship on Sunday,
and did not neglect to have family prayers in
his own home. He generally attended his own
church in the morning, and after dinner in the
afternoon would roam about the city, and visit
more than one place of worship. Take for an
example an account of one Sunday. After being
present at his own church in the forenoon, and
dining, he says: “I went and ranged and ranged
about to many churches, among the rest to the
Temple, where I heard Dr.&nbsp;Wilkins a <em>little</em>.”</p>

<p>It is to be feared pretty faces and not powerful
preachers often induced him to go to the house
<a name="p245" id="p245"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>245<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of prayer. Writing on August 11th, 1661, he
says: “To our own church in the forenoon, and
in the afternoon to Clerkenwell Church, only to
see the two fair Botelers.” He managed to
obtain a seat where he could have a good view
of them, but they did not charm him, for he
says: “I am now out of conceit with them.”
Another Sunday he writes: “By coach to
Greenwich Church, where a good sermon, a
fine church, and a good company of handsome
women.” At another church he visited he says
that his pretty black girl was present.</p>

<p>Pepys has much to say about the sermons he
heard, and when they were dull he went to sleep.
Judging from his frequent records of slumbering
in church, prosy preachers were by no means
rare in his day.</p>

<p>Writing on the 4th August, 1662, he gives us
a glimpse of the manners of a rustic church.
His cousin Roger himself attended the service,
and says Pepys: “At our coming in, the country
people all rose with so much reverence; and
when the parson begins, he begins, ‘Right worshipful
and dearly beloved’ to us.”</p>

<p>Conversation appears to have been freely
carried<!-- TN: original reads "carred" --> on in city churches. “In my pew,” says
<a name="p246" id="p246"></a><span class="pageno"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>246<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Pepys, “both Sir Williams and I had much talk
about the death of Sir Robert.” Laughter was
by no means unusual. “Before sermon,” writes
Pepys, “I laughed at the reader, who, in his
prayer, desired God that he would imprint his
Word on the thumbs of our right hands and on
the right toes of our right feet.”</p>

<p>When Pepys remained at home on Sunday he
frequently cast up his accounts, and there are in
his Diary several allusions to this subject.</p>

<p>“Mr. Andrews’ volume is admirably produced, and contains a collection

<p>“Mr. William Andrews, of Hull, is an indefatigable searcher amongst
the byways of ancient English history, and it would be difficult to name an
antiquary who, along his chosen lines, has made so thoroughly interesting
and instructive the mass of facts a painstaking industry has brought to
light. For twenty-five years he has been delving into the subject of
Bygone Punishments, and is now one of the best authorities upon obsolete
systems of jurisdiction and torture, for torture was, in various forms, the
main characteristic of punishment in the good old times. The reformation
of the person punished was a far more remote object of retribution than it
is with us, and even with us reform is very much a matter of sentiment.
Punishment was intended to be punishment to the individual in the first
place, and in the second a warning to the rest. It is a gruesome study,
but Mr Andrews nowhere writes for mere effect. As an antiquary ought
to do, he has made the collection of facts and their preservation for modern
students of history in a clear, straightforward narrative his main object, and
in this volume he keeps to it consistently. Every page is therefore full of
curious, out-of-the-way facts, with authorities and references amply
quoted.”&mdash;<cite>Yorkshire Post.</cite></p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
